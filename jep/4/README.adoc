== Abstract

As the Jenkins community has grown, there have been ad hoc groups sprouting up
to tackle specific areas of focus within the project. This proposal describes a
"Special Interest Group" (SIG) model to provide structure so that these groups can
become more formalized, with consistent expectations of their operation, to
help new contributors join areas of effort which align with their interests.

[[specification]]
== Specification

Much of this specification is modeled after the Kubernetes project's "SIG"
model. footnoteref:[sig-governance, https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-governance.md]


In order to standardize Special Interest Group efforts, create maximum
transparency, and route contributors to the appropriate SIG, SIGs should follow
the guidelines stated below:

* Meet regularly, at least for 30 minutes every 3 weeks, except November and December
* Keep up-to-date meeting notes, somewhere publicly linked from the SIG's page on jenkins.io
* Announce meeting agenda and minutes after each meeting, on their SIG mailing list
* Record SIG meeting, either via <<video, YouTube Live Streaming>>, or via
  text-based meetings which can use `#jenkins-meeting` on
  Freenode. SIG meetings must be public and should have their meeting recorded
  (video or text) or the meeting minutes published afterwards.
* Ensure the SIG's mailing list, and optional chat channel are archived
* Report activity in the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda?cache[bi-weekly Governance Meeting] at least once every 6 weeks
* Participate in release planning meetings and retrospectives, and burndown
  meetings, as needed.
* Ensure related work happens in a project-owned GitHub org and repository,
  with code and tests explicitly owned and supported by the SIG, including issue
  triage, PR reviews, test-failure response, bug fixes, etc.
* Use the above forums as the primary means of working, communicating, and
  collaborating, as opposed to private emails and meetings


All Special Interest Groups are subject to the Jenkins project
link:https://jenkins.io/conduct[Code of Conduct].

=== Roles

- **SIG Participant**: active in one or more areas of the project; wide
  variety of roles are represented
- **SIG Lead**: SIG organizer

=== Creation and Maintenance

==== Prerequisites

* Propose the new SIG publicly, including a brief mission statement, by
  emailing jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com and jenkinsci-users@googlegroups.com,
  then wait a couple of days for feedback
* Organize meetings using video or text as needed. No need to wait for the a
  regularly scheduled Jenkins Governance meeting to discuss. Please report
  summary of ad hoc SIG meetings to the the SIG mailing list.
* Use existing proposal and <<pull-request, PR process>>
* Announce new SIG on jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com
* Submit a PR to add a row for the SIG to the table in the jenkins.io/sigs
  page, to create a kubernetes/community directory, and to add any SIG-related
  docs, schedules, roadmaps, etc. to your new jenkins.io/sig/foo directory

=== Creating service accounts for the SIG

With a purpose to distribute the channels of notification and discussion of the
various topics, every SIG has to use multiple accounts to GitHub mentioning and
notifications. Below the procedure is explained step-by-step.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is largely maintained by link:https://github.com[R Tyler Croy]
on the Jenkins Infrastructure team, please file INFRA tickets in
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[JIRA] or post
to the link:http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/mailman/listinfo/jenkins-infra[Infra mailing list]
in case of questions or suggestions.
====

==== Google Groups creation

Create Google Groups at
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!creategroup[],
following the procedure:

* Each SIG should have one discussion groups, and a number of groups for mirroring relevant github notifications;
* Create groups using the name conventions below;
* Groups should be created as e-mail lists with at least three owners
  (including tyler at monkeypox.org and verninol at gmail.com to ensure SIG
  continuity);
* To add the owners, visit the Group Settings (drop-down menu on the right
  side), select Direct Add Members on the left side and add Tyler and Olivier
  via email address (with a suitable welcome message); in Members/All Members
  select Tyler and Olivier and assign t hem to an "owner role" for long term
  maintenance.
* Set "View topics", "Post", "Join the Group" permissions to be "Public"

Name convention:

* jenkins-foo (the discussion group)

[[video]]
==== Recorded Video Meetings

Video meetings should be recorded with Hangouts on Air via the Jenkins projects
link:https://www.youtube.com/c/jenkinscicd[YouTube Channel].

Each SIG Lead wishing to host video meetings should file an INFRA ticket to
request
link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7311601?visit_id=1-636590077002254769-397511081&p=brand_accounts_managers&rd=1[Manager access]
to the YouTube channel. Manager access allows SIG Leads to schedule a
link:https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events[Live Streaming Event]
which will allow meeting contributors to use Google Hangouts to discuss, while
allowing participants to view the YouTube live stream, or after the fact, the
recording.

All recorded events should be filed into a YouTube Playlist titled "SIG <Name>
Meetings" to keep the YouTube channel properly organized.

[[irc]]
==== Recorded IRC Meetings

The Jenkins project already operates a `#jenkins-meeting` channel on the
Freenode network which can be used for recording IRC-based meetings. While
<<video, Video Meetings>> are preferred, text-based meetings are also
allowed.

SIG Leads should request operator status for the `#jenkins-meeting` channel,
and should consult the link:https://jenkins.io/event-calendar/[Jenkins Event
Calendar] to make sure their meetings do not overlap with those already
scheduled.


==== Create the GitHub teams

GitHub teams for the SIG should following the naming convention listed below.
To create a team, a SIG lead should file an INFRA ticket linking to the SIG
proposal on the jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list with a mention of
which GitHub organizations in which the team should be created.

Name convention:

* sig-foo

[NOTE]
====
There should not be a sig-foo team. We want to encourage contributors to select
the most appropriate team to notify.
====


== Motivation


As link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/03/20/evolving-mission-of-jenkins/[Jenkins continues to grow and evolve]
the "main" community discussion forums and channels have become increasingly
busy, causing contributor fatigue and unproductive discussions for more
specialized focus areas.

The Jenkins project already has _some_ loose conventional structure around
groups with specialization such as:

* **Infrastructure**: group responsible for maintaining the Jenkins project's
  primary infrastructure.
* **Google Summer of Code**: group of organizers and mentors for the Jenkins
  project's participation in link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code].
* **LTS**: group led by the Release Office organizing the Long Term Support
  release line.

These groups have vaguely consistent structure but lack consistent
representation and process which leads to confusion about how these groups
should be operated, what qualifies as a "group", and how new-comers should
participate.


== Reasoning

As mentioned in the <<specification>>, much of this is modeled after the
Kubernetes SIG process footnoteref:[sig-governance], which is a *much* larger
open source community at this point than the Jenkins project. This design is
well-tested and provides a reasonable middle-ground between flexibility for SIG
Leads, without encouraging each SIG to reinvent their own bespoke process.


== Backwards Compatibility

Nothing relevant for this JEP.


== Security

Nothing relevant for this JEP.

== Infrastructure Requirements

This document describes avenues for many more Jenkins contributors to have
access to resources which have traditionally only been accessed by
infrastructure administrators.

This requires that access control must be shared for:

* the YouTube channel, via the
  link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7001996[Brand account]
* Newly created Google Groups.
* `#jenkins-meeting` on Freenode.


== Testing

Nothing relevant for this JEP.

== Prototype Implementation

Nothing relevant for this JEP.

== References

* Much of the "SIG" concept has been borrowed heavily from the
  link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md#sigs[Kubernetes community].
