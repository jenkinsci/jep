== Abstract

As the Jenkins community has grown, there have been ad hoc groups sprouting up
to tackle specific areas of focus within the project. This proposal describes a
"Special Interest Group" (SIG) model to provide structure so that these groups can
become more formalized, with consistent expectations of their operation, to
help new contributors join areas of effort which align with their interests.

[[specification]]
== Specification

Much of this specification is modeled after the Kubernetes project's "SIG"
model. footnoteref:[sig-governance, https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-governance.md]


In order to standardize Special Interest Group efforts, create maximum
transparency, and route contributors to the appropriate SIG, SIGs should follow
the guidelines stated below:

* Meet regularly, at least for 30 minutes every month
* Keep up-to-date meeting notes, somewhere publicly linked from the SIG's page on jenkins.io
* Announce meeting agenda and minutes after each meeting, on their SIG mailing list
* Record SIG meeting, either via <<video, YouTube Live Streaming>>, or via
  text-based meetings which can use `#jenkins-meeting` on
  Freenode. SIG meetings must be public and should have their meeting recorded
  (video or text) or the meeting minutes published afterwards.
* Ensure the SIG's mailing list, and optional chat channel are archived
* Report activity in the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda?cache[bi-weekly Governance Meeting] at least once every 6 weeks
* Participate in Governance meetings, as needed.
* Ensure related work happens in a project-owned GitHub org and repository,
  with code and tests explicitly owned and supported by the SIG, including issue
  triage, PR reviews, test-failure response, bug fixes, etc.
* Use the above forums as the primary means of working, communicating, and
  collaborating, as opposed to private emails and meetings


All Special Interest Groups are subject to the Jenkins project
link:https://jenkins.io/conduct[Code of Conduct].

=== Roles

- **SIG Participant**: active in one or more areas of the project; wide
  variety of roles are represented
- **SIG Lead**: SIG organizer. SIG may have multiple leaders

=== Creation and Maintenance

==== Prerequisites

* Propose the new SIG publicly, including a brief mission statement, by
  emailing jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com and jenkinsci-users@googlegroups.com,
  then wait a couple of days for feedback
* Define a unique SIG identifier (`${sigId}` below):
** Permitted symbols: `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`
** Length: up to 32 symbols
** Examples: `platform` (Platform SIG), `cloud-native-jenkins`, etc.
* Organize meetings using video or text as needed. No need to wait for the a
  regularly scheduled Jenkins Governance meeting to discuss. Please report
  summary of ad hoc SIG meetings to the the SIG mailing list.
* Use existing proposal and <<pull-request, PR process>>
* Announce new SIG on jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com
* Submit a pull request to the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/[jenkins-infra/jenkins.io] repository
** Create a `/content/sigs/${sigId}` directory.
This directory can be used to store any SIG-related pages, docs, schedules, roadmaps, etc.
** Create a `/content/sigs/${sigId}/index.adoc` file.
It will be used as a landing page for your SIG.
The `index.adoc` will also contain metadata about the SIG.
See other files in the directory for examples of what that should look like. 

==== SIGs and JEPs

Creation of new SIGs does NOT require creation of new JEPs.
As documented above, am email to the Developer mailing list is enough.

Additional JEPs may be created if SIG Leaders want to define special processes and requirements
for the Special Interest group (e.g. requirements to be a Security SIG member).
If such JEPs are created, they will be a subject to the common review process
defined in link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/1[JEP-1].

=== Creating service accounts for the SIG

With a purpose to distribute the channels of notification and discussion of the
various topics, every SIG may use multiple communication channels.
Below the procedure is explained step-by-step.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is largely maintained by the Jenkins Infrastructure team,
please file INFRA tickets in link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[JIRA] or post
to the link:http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/mailman/listinfo/jenkins-infra[Infra mailing list]
in case of questions or suggestions.
====

==== Google Groups creation

Create Google Groups at
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!creategroup[],
following the procedure:

* Each SIG must have at least one discussion group.
This group must be added to the SIG metadata.
* SIGs may also have a number of groups for mirroring relevant github notifications;
* Create groups using the name conventions below;
* Groups must be created as e-mail lists with at least three owners
  (including tyler at monkeypox.org and verninol at gmail.com to ensure SIG
  continuity);
* To add the owners, visit the Group Settings (drop-down menu on the right
  side), select Direct Add Members on the left side and add Tyler and Olivier
  via email address (with a suitable welcome message); in Members/All Members
  select Tyler and Olivier and assign them to an "owner role" for long term
  maintenance.
* Set "View topics", "Post", "Join the Group" permissions to be "Public"

Naming convention: `jenkins-${sigId}-sig` (the discussion group)

[[organizations]]
==== Organizations

At the discretion of the SIG Lead(s), organizations may also join SIGs.
Organizations may request to join a SIG and will then be listed on the SIG page.
It is expected that organizations that join a SIG will actively participate in 
the dicusssion and interation on the SIG. 
Organization membership is in SIG informational only 
and grants the organization no special power or voice in that SIG.


[[video]]
==== Recorded Video Meetings

Video meetings should be recorded with Hangouts on Air via the Jenkins projects
link:https://www.youtube.com/c/jenkinscicd[YouTube Channel].

Each SIG Lead wishing to host video meetings should file an INFRA ticket to
request
link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7311601?visit_id=1-636590077002254769-397511081&p=brand_accounts_managers&rd=1[Manager access]
to the YouTube channel. Manager access allows SIG Leads to schedule a
link:https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events[Live Streaming Event]
which will allow meeting contributors to use Google Hangouts to discuss, while
allowing participants to view the YouTube live stream, or after the fact, the
recording.

All recorded events should be filed into a YouTube Playlist titled "SIG <Name>
Meetings" to keep the YouTube channel properly organized.

[[irc]]
==== Recorded IRC Meetings

The Jenkins project already operates a `#jenkins-meeting` channel on the
Freenode network which can be used for recording IRC-based meetings. While
<<video, Video Meetings>> are preferred, text-based meetings are also
allowed.

SIG Leads should request operator status for the `#jenkins-meeting` channel,
and should consult the link:https://jenkins.io/event-calendar/[Jenkins Event
Calendar] to make sure their meetings do not overlap with those already
scheduled.

[[chat]]
==== Chats

SIGs can *optionally* create dedicated channels for chats.
These chats may be located in IRC, Gitter, Slack, or other channels.
SIG leaders set up channels on their own, unless special permissions are needed
(in that case, INFRA tickets should be created).
If such chats are created, they should be referenced in SIG metadata.


==== Create the GitHub teams

In order to allow GitHub mentioning, SIGs can *optionally* have GitHub teams.
To create a team, a SIG lead should file an INFRA ticket linking to the SIG
proposal on the jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list with a mention of
which GitHub organizations in which the team should be created.

Naming convention: `${githubOrg}/sig-${sigId}` (e.g. `jenkinsci/sig-platform`)

=== Changing leaders and adopting SIGs

If there is no activity in SIGs for more than 2 months (2 meeting intervals),
a SIG may be marked for adoption.
In such case any SIG participant will be able to take leadership of the SIG.

"Marking for adoption" process:

* The process is similar to adopting plugins
* If a SIG leader wants to step down, he/she may propose the leadership transfer
* If there is no activity, a SIG participant or other Jenkins contributor may raise
a question about SIG ownership transfer
* Leadership change proposals should be sent to the primary SIG mailing list,
the current SIG leader(s) should be in CC.
* Leadership transfer may happen if there is a consensus between SIG participants in the thread
* In the case of adopting SIG due to inactivity,
there is a 2-week response timeout to give a chance to the SIG leader(s) to process the request
* SIG leadership transfer happens by changing SIG metadata on jenkins.io and
announcing the change in the Developer mailing list
* The new SIG leader(s) are expected to create INFRA tickets to get
the permission transfer for SIG resources

== Motivation


As link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/03/20/evolving-mission-of-jenkins/[Jenkins continues to grow and evolve]
the "main" community discussion forums and channels have become increasingly
busy, causing contributor fatigue and unproductive discussions for more
specialized focus areas.

The Jenkins project already has _some_ loose conventional structure around
groups with specialization such as:

* **Infrastructure**: group responsible for maintaining the Jenkins project's
  primary infrastructure.
* **Google Summer of Code**: group of organizers and mentors for the Jenkins
  project's participation in link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code].
* **LTS**: group led by the Release Office organizing the Long Term Support
  release line.

These groups have vaguely consistent structure but lack consistent
representation and process which leads to confusion about how these groups
should be operated, what qualifies as a "group", and how new-comers should
participate.


== Reasoning

As mentioned in the <<specification>>, much of this is modeled after the
Kubernetes SIG process footnoteref:[sig-governance], which is a *much* larger
open source community at this point than the Jenkins project. This design is
well-tested and provides a reasonable middle-ground between flexibility for SIG
Leads, without encouraging each SIG to reinvent their own bespoke process.


== Backwards Compatibility

Nothing relevant for this JEP.


== Security

Nothing relevant for this JEP.

== Infrastructure Requirements

This document describes avenues for many more Jenkins contributors to have
access to resources which have traditionally only been accessed by
infrastructure administrators.

This requires that access control must be shared for:

* the YouTube channel, via the
  link:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7001996[Brand account]
* Newly created Google Groups.
* `#jenkins-meeting` on Freenode.


== Testing

Nothing relevant for this JEP.
