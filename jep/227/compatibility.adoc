Use this space to track the status of plugins that may or may not be compatible with JEP-227.
Refer to general information about link:README.adoc#backwards-compatibility[backwards compatibility]
for tips on searching for potentially problematic API usages.

Plugins which do not do anything special with Acegi Security or Spring types need not be listed.
In particular, some very routine usages such as `ACL.as(ACL.SYSTEM)` are not cause for concern
since core retains binary compatibility for these.
All link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/jenkins-core/#securityrealm[plugins defining a `SecurityRealm`] should be listed.

Please use pull requests as needed to help maintain the following table.
Plugins should be sorted by code identifier
(usually, but not always, the portion in the GitHub repository name preceding `-plugin`).

If you file issues in Jira, please apply the `JEP-227` label as well as noting them here.

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/pull/38[reverse-proxy-auth-plugin #38]
is merely cleanup to make it easier to even test against new cores.

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/pull/37[reverse-proxy-auth-plugin #37]
would permit the LDAP-specific portions to be split into its own extension point and perhaps even plugin,
which could allow the core portion to be made compatible with Spring Security more easily.

The plugin has not been released in 2½ years;
even then it was only released by Jenkins CERT members
to allow critical fixes for link:../200/README.adoc[JEP-200]
