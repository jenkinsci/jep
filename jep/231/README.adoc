== Abstract

This JEP describes the steps taken to remove link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-digester/[Apache Commons Digester] as a dependency of Jenkins Core.

== Specification

Removing link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-digester/[Apache Commons Digester] from Jenkins Core requires changes to Core and to a number of plugins.
We will describe these two groups of changes separately.

=== Core

Jenkins Core implemented 
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/22fcc54bd3879c765b5595371e57fd180860daff/core/src/main/java/hudson/util/Digester2.java[`hudson.util.Digester2`] 
which extended `org.apache.commons.digester.Digester`
attempting to set secure parsing defaults to prevent XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerabilities.
Neither class was used by Jenkins Core, `hudson.util.Digester2` was purely provided as a helper for plugins.

=== Plugins

Plugins will need to be updated to avoid breaking during this change.
The changes needed are relatively straightforward.
Assuming the dependency cannot be removed, the code changes needed are generally not complex.

==== Example changes to plugin code

===== Removing Digester

Plugins may be better off not using Digester at all, taking this opportunity to replace some scary-looking reflection with plain old Java programming.
The changes needed in that case will vary depending on the plugin, but an example can be seen in
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/mercurial-plugin/commit/84af58b08f80bb92792f7bc04a31487f3eeee95a[mercurial-plugin @ `84af58b`]
and another in
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/subversion-plugin/pull/259[subversion-plugin #259].
In both of these cases, Digester was being used to convert an XML file in a fairly simple format to some POJOs used for changelogs:

* Remove the Maven dependency on Digester (and Commons Beanutils if relevant).
* Use `XMLUtils.parse` to actually parse the file to DOM.
  (Or you could use DOM4j or other APIs. Just be careful to use XXE-safe parser configurations.)
* Replace `addObjectCreate` configurations with calls to the POJO constructor in a loop.
* Replace `addSetProperties` configurations with code to get DOM element attributes and call corresponding POJO setters.
  (Remember that `""` may be the same as an attribute which is not present.)
* Replace `addBeanPropertySetter` configurations with checks for child elements whose text content can be bound to POJO setters.
* Consult Digester Javadoc for other similar configuration methods.
  Refer to sample XML files read by tests to see what you are parsing.

When you have everything working, consider simplifying the resulting POJO(s) and parser using regular Java refactoring tools.
The JavaBeans-style pattern preferred by Digester (no-argument constructor plus `public` getter/setter)
is not necessarily the most legible and maintainable.
POJO classes could take fields in a package-accessible constructor rather than a setter.
Getters could be given more limited Java access, if they are not being used e.g. for `@Exported` or `@Override`.
Field/method names need not match XML attribute/element names if it would be more natural to align with other APIs.
Look for unused methods and gratuitous `public` modifiers.

===== Securing Digester

If making that more significant change is not feasible, plugins can be updated using the following code snippet to configure Digester with more secure settings: 

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.commons.digester3.Digester;
....
public static Digester createDigester(boolean secure) throws SAXException {
    Digester digester = new Digester();
    if (secure) {
        digester.setXIncludeAware(false);
        try {
            digester.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
            digester.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
            digester.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
            digester.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
        } catch (ParserConfigurationException ex) {
            throw new SAXException("Failed to securely configure xml digester parser", ex);
        }
    }
    return digester;
}
----

==== Affected plugins (fixes planned)


Below is a table of the affected plugins with PRs submitted to fix their breaks.
These PRs may or may not be merged before removal is complete, depending on whether
maintainers merge and release the submitted PRs.

This table will be updated as needed to track the state of each plugin.

Legend:

* :heavy_check_mark: Fixed or no need to fix
* :stop_sign: 	     It's not going to be fixed (no maintainer mainly)
* :exclamation: 	 Waiting for something (merge or release)

==== Affected plugins (no fixes planned)

===== Suspended plugins

Some plugins were found which were suspended when Jenkins 2 was released.
These will not be updated as part of this effort.

* https://plugins.jenkins.io/svn-release-mgr suspended since https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-2487
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/cpptest-plugin suspended since https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-2487
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/tfs-plugin suspended since https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-2751
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/cflint-plugin (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/CFLint-plugin/pull/3[PR-3]) suspended since https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-2751
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/script-scm-plugin SECURITY-461
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/rtc-plugin (superseded by team-concert)


===== Never released plugins

Some plugins were never released.
These will not be updated as part of this effort.

* https://github.com/jenkinsci/cocoemma-plugin
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/jwsdp-sqe-plugin
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/pucm-plugin
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/purecm-plugin


== Motivation

The link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-digester/[Apache Commons Digester]
included as a dependency of Jenkins Core is old and poorly maintained.
Digester and its dependencies have been a source of a number of security vulnerabilities. 
Examples of this include: 

* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2304[CVE-2020-2304]
* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2305[CVE-2020-2305]
* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000054[CVE-2018-1000054]
* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000055[CVE-2018-1000055]

The version of Digester could be updated, but in some sense any use of Digester is inherently risky from a security perspective:

* XML is overcomplicated and the XML parsing might be subject to XXE, allowing clever attacks to do things like load `../../../credentials.xml`.
* Even after verifying the input is a plain old self-contained XML document, Digester still takes user-controlled strings and uses them to look up and invoke Java methods, which is subject to abuse in numerous ways.

Over 15 years ago, the `Digester2` class was added to Jenkins Core to address 
link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIGESTER-118[DIGESTER-118].
In the years since then, all usages of `Digester` and `Digester2` have been removed from Jenkins Core itself.
They remain only to avoid breaking plugins that depend on `Digester` and `Digester2` .

However, this means that addressing security issues related to `Digester` generally requires an update to Jenkins Core.
Also, because Digester is a dependency of Core, some plugins continue to use the `Digester` class being provided by from the dependency rather than using the `Digester2` API provided by Jenkins.

The right thing to do is to remove the Digester dependency from Jenkins Core along with the `Digester2` class.
Then the plugins that actually use Digester can handle any security concerns themselves.
Plugins that use `Digester` or `Digester2` will need to be updated or they will break after this removal, however only those plugins will need updating.
The number of plugins affected is relatively small and the minimal change required to unbreak them is relatively straightforward. 

== Reasoning

=== Risks of complete removal

We chose to remove Digester from Jenkins Core in a manner that causes plugins which depend on it to fail unless they are updated.
We made this choice based on an analysis of all plugins which are currently distributed by the Jenkins Update Center or which are
in a repository in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[`jenkinsci` org on GitHub].
All but a few of the plugins affected by this change are some combination of unmaintained, rarely used, and no longer or never published.
We submitted PRs to all affected plugins.


=== Detached plugin to maintain compatibility

The current plan causes plugins which depend on Jenkins to provide Digester to fail unless they are updated.
This could be mitigated by moving this dependency to a detached plugin.
We decided against creating a detached pluging because there were a small number of affected plugins and only a few of them have significant install base.
The creating and maintaining of a detached plugin would still be a significant amount of work and would cause the security vulnerabilities we are trying to address to remain open.

=== Testing limited to known plugins

We considered using `plugin-compat-tester` to test on a broad set of plugins beyond those known to be affected
(link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/pull/361/files#r633849804[PR thread]). It was decided that the code searches we did within the `jenkinsci` repositories were sufficient. We could not think of any failures that would be caught by the PCT that were not already addressed by the code search. 

== Backwards Compatibility

The current plan causes plugins which depend on Jenkins to provide Digester to fail unless they are updated.
The majority of this JEP is devoted to discussion of how to mitigate these breaks.
