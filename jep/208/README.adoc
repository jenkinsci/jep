== Abstract

Configuration-as-Code (JEP-201) describes the mechanisms used to configure a Jenkins master based
on yaml file(s), by discovering the data model from Java API, without the need to write any "glue-code"
for each and every supported plugin.

This approach comes with some drawback: Any update to Jenkins master's core or plugins will change the
inferred model, and as such a yaml configuration used a `t` time might not be valid at `t+1`. This concern
has been raised by many early-adopters.

This proposal is about defining the adequate tooling to balance this limitation, so both end-users
and plugin maintainer are able to detect such compatibility breaks, and provide some diagnostic and
resolution hints.

== Specification

Configuration-as-Code tooling is designed to fill the gap between the raw mechanism defined by JEP-201
to configure a specific jenkins-core + plugins combination, and the need to keep this configuration
stable during core or plugin upgrades, or at least detect breaking changes and provide hints to manage
upgrade.

This includes:

- tooling to validate configuration, sort of a "dry-run" mode, with adequate diagnostic when some
configuration mismatch is detected.
- tooling to compare inferred model between versions, to be used by plugin developers to be aware
changes they made during development might have impact on Configuration-as-Code.
- Document recommendations for plugin developers on ways to avoid breaking changes
- Metadata definition for plugin developers to document breaking changes and how to fix them. Based
on this, when yaml validation do detect a configuration mismatch it can offer migration hints.


== Motivation

Configuration-as-Code doesn't define a data model to setup jenkins, it's based on inferring a model
from live jenkins instance from its Java API, especially UI data-binding mechanisms. Based on this,
changes made to core or a plugin _might_ change this model and a configuration file _could_ not be
valid after upgrade.

There's not so much cases where such compatibility breaks could happen, but there's chances this would.
Compared to other tools, like `docker-compose`, we can't provide a `version` attribute and accept
distinct models, as we only know about the live, inferred one.

Configuration-as-Code tooling is defined to work around this limitation by providing a toolset to
discover such breaking changes early, before the actual production configuration is updated.
It will help detect breaking changes during jenkins and plugins development, offer an option for
plugin developers to document required breaking changes, and validate a configuration for a specific
jenkins instance before it get actually applied.

== Reasoning

Without an explicit versioned model per jenkins-core and plugin versions Configuration-as-Code only
can rely offer some minimal backward compatibility.


=== Relax Configuration-asCode for backward compatibility ?

There's few circumstances where we have options
to work around a technical change in Jenkins or plugin codebase as the technical bits are still available,
just hidden by the default "model inference" mechanism.

A typical sample for this has been debated on
https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/issues/233[issue 233]: `JNLPLauncher` DataBound
constructor has been updated in jenkins codebase to introduce new argument `workDirSettings`. This one
is declared in API as `@Nonnull`, which means Configuration-as-Code will infer a required attribute. As
a result, previous definition for a JNLP launcher will be broken as this attribute isn't declared. But on
the other side, the legacy constructor is still available (but deprecated) and do define a default value
for this new argument.

**Shall we just relax Configuration-as-Code so it still can apply an outdated model ?**

We don't think so, as doing so would eventually bring us to indeterminable configuration paths:
As we allow use of deprecated constructor (or setters, or ...) we might result with colliding candidates
to invoke, without a deterministic way to select the adequate one.

To follow-up with this specific sample, JNLPLauncher do define (at time writing) two deprecated constructors
and another non-deprecated one :

```java
@Deprecated
public JNLPLauncher(String tunnel, String vmargs) { ... }

@Deprecated
public JNLPLauncher() { ... }

public JNLPLauncher(boolean enableWorkDir) { ... }
```

The sole one we can guarantee is designed to submit configuration is the @DataBound one. For others
there's no deterministic way to choose one. Even considering the configuration attributes we have from
yaml file, which one should we use if configuration doesn't define `enableWorkDir`, `tunnel` nor `vmargs`?
first one passing `null, null` of non-deprecated one passing `false` default value ?

=== During Jenkins development

Actually the exact same code change discussed in https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/issues/233[issue 233]
could have been implemented without breaking Configuration-as-Code inferred model :

- by defining a `@DataBoundSetter` for newly introduced `workDirSettings` attribute
- by not defining `workDirSettings` argument as `@Nonnull` and applying default value

Assuming Configuration-as-Code would exist for some time when this change was applied to jenkins-core, we
might have detected it during code review and prevented this to happen.

Configuration-as-Code tooling wants to avoid such unnecessary breaking changes to happen in the future.
But as it wasn't there before developers aren't aware of this constraint, and we can't just ask them
to keep our use-case in mind any time they write some code (there's already enough backward compatibility
issues for them to address).

Configuration-as-Code tooling do define tooling to detect such breaking changes, and warn developer about
them. This tooling do run the model inference logic and compare with previous state of the codebase. This
will warn developer about breaking change being introduced for Configuration-as-Code users.

Sometime such changes are actually required. For such situation we propose some metadata being added aside
changes made to codebase so Configuration-as-Code can give end-user some hints on the break and how to fix
it.

=== Before applying configuration

On end-user side we want ot offer a validation toolkit to be used when applying configuration on a jenkins
instance. This toolkit do parse the yaml configuration, try to apply configuration on the inferred model,
and will report issue detected during this dry-run configuration process.

It would rely on breaking changes metadata to offer end-user some guidance on way to address reported
backward compatibility issues.

Configuration-as-Code tooling to check for API backward compatibility will need to be
included in the CI process, so it can inform plugin developers and contributors on breaking changes
detection.

This JEP submission is only informative so far about our intents to address this concern
