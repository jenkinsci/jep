== Abstract

One of the four pillars of Jenkins Essentials is that it should be link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300#sane-defaults[autoconfigured with sane defaults for various cloud platforms]. This specification explains what setup is done to autoconfigure Jenkins Essentials to run in the link:https://aws.amazon.com[Amazon Web Service] environment.

== Specification

=== Global overview

The setup uses an link:https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation[AWS _CloudFormation_ template] that instantiates the right resources.

It creates an EC2 instance, to host the Jenkins Essentials master in a dedicated Instance Profile.
The master will be able to provision agents from EC2, and store artifacts directly in S3.

=== Used plugins and configuration

* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2[EC2 plugin]: to provide dynamically provisioned agents
  footnote:[even more important for Jenkins Essentials which is configured with the link:JENKINS-49861[sane 0-executor for the master node]].
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifact-manager-s3[Artifact Manager on S3 plugin]: to store artifacts and Pipeline stashes in Amazon S3.

// JENKINS-52342 for ^ which is the design, but not done fully yet.

As a general rule for Essentials, we are using the `configuration-as-code` plugin to do the necessary configuration.

*No credentials* are specified.
The permissions are retrieved dynamically through the instance profile used when creating the EC2 instance for the Essentials master.

=== Instance Profile and IAM role

A dedicated instance profile is created by the _CloudFormation_ template to allow creating EC2 instances for agents, and access a specific S3 bucket to store artifacts and Pipeline stashes.

==== EC2 policy

[source,json]
"Statement": [{
    "Sid": "ControlEC2JenkinsAgents",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "ec2:RequestSpotInstances",
        "ec2:DeleteTags",
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:DescribeRegions",
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeSpotInstanceRequests",
        "ec2:StopInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:GetConsoleOutput",
        "ec2:DescribeImages",
        "ec2:CancelSpotInstanceRequests",
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}]

==== S3 bucket policy

[source,json]
"Statement": [{
        "Sid": "TodoRefineSecurity-JENKINS-52342",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:DeleteObject"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
]

CAUTION: Currently the prototype is configured with the way shown above.
We would like to reduce the access to only the dedicated bucket created for Jenkins Essentials usage.
We are tracking this improvement as link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52342[JENKINS-52342].

=== Security groups

==== Master
A dedicated group is created to allow access to the following ports:

22:: restricted to the `SSHLocation` parameter value, passed as CloudFormation template parameter at creation time.
The user will be strongly advised to use their own public IP to restrict SSH access to the master to her only (i.e. discourage `0.0.0.0/0`).
footnote:[using `curl ident.me` is often to help find out one' public IP and pass the value to the CloudFormation template parameter.]
8080:: not restricted.
50000:: not restricted (for potentially connecting agents with JNLP).

NOTE: The port `50000` is not currently enabled inside the Essentials instance.
But we keep it allowed at the security group and Docker container level.
This will allow users to connect for instance Windows agents through the  Jenkins `JNLP` protocol by simply enabling the fixed agents port under `/configureSecurity/`.


==== Agents

A dedicated group is created to allow only access to port `22`.

== Motivation

Nothing was existing to provide an autoconfigured setup of Jenkins in a specific Cloud environment.

== Reasoning

=== Instance Profile

Early during the prototype, a dedicated _service user_ was used.
This was replaced by instance profile later for various reasons.

This is because it is the recommended path for AWS, but also because doing so makes the configuration leaner:
both the _EC2_ and _Artifact Manager on S3_ plugins will autodetect their permissions if no explicit credentials are specified.

=== `s3:DeleteObject` permission on the S3 bucket

Keeping this permission has been questioned; why allow deletion permission when:

* _pure_ AWS administrators may prefer to define a lifecycle policy to clean up things;
* S3 is so cheap that _we_, at least, should not care about deletions?

We decided to keep it because:

* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300[Essentials is critically about simplicity].
  If a user, or us a bit later, wants to enable to delete checkbox of the `artifact-manager-s3` plugin, this should be possible without having to go through the AWS console or CLI to find the right settings;
* Keeping everything _forever_ is also probably some kind of liability.
  And if some users have previously been administering a Jenkins instance previously, but they are not AWS experts, their expectation would probably be that artifacts are going to be cleaned up over time, according to the `buildDiscarder` policy in place.

== Backwards Compatibility

There are no backwards compatibility concerns related to this proposal.

== Security

=== Allowed certificates

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/307#security[JEP 307] aggressively restricts the list of certificates that will be allowed to be used from inside Essentials container.

Two more need to be re-enabled for the Essentials AWS flavor to be able to auto-detect permissions given by the current instance profile:

* `Baltimore_CyberTrust_Root.crt`: for S3.
* `Amazon_Root_CA_1.crt`: for EC2.

=== SSH access to the server

A CloudFormation template parameter `SSHLocation` is used to define the IPs allowed to access the master using SSH.

Users are advised to pass only their own IP when creating their setup.
But SSH is deemed sufficiently secure so that we still allow users to pass `0.0.0.0/0` as a value if they want this.

=== HTTPS by default

(?) TBD FIXME

=== Agent port

WIP: FIXME: do we even need to open it. Does the agent actually connect through the SSH pipe?

== Infrastructure Requirements

[[aws-account]]
=== AWS account for testing

If we want to be able to run automated tests, we need some form of AWS account to actually check the CloudFormation works and keep working. See below <<aws-testing>>.

== Testing

[[aws-testing]]
=== AWS testing of CloudFormation template

Given an <<aws-account>>, we can use the `aws` CLI to automatically trigger the provisioning, then retrieve what is neeeded to run automated tests:

* create the stack using `aws cloudformation create-stack ...`
* retrieve the EC2 instance IP using:
** `aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name <just-created-stack>`,
** and `aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-<retrieved-ID> | grep -i publicIp`
* run some tests, e.g.:
** is the <masterIp>/login URL reachable, etc..
** use `ssh ec2-user <masterIp> docker exec jenkins-essentials <some-command>` to do additional automated checks from the running instance itself.
