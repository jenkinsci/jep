== Abstract

Jenkins offers an API allowing WebSocket services to be implemented.
This is available using the Stapler `HttpResponse` idiom,
served as the final action after the regular Stapler routing mechanism.
Unlike regular HTTP endpoints, bidirectional streaming communication is possible.

The principal service exposed in this way is a new Remoting transport for inbound build agents at an HTTP(S) URL.
The agent itself (typically named `agent.jar`) includes a WebSocket client capable of connecting to this endpoint.
This provides an alternative to using the `JNLP4-connect` protocol on the Jenkins TCP port.
Otherwise the regular behavior of inbound agents (`JNLPLauncher`) applies.

The Jenkins CLI could also be served via WebSocket in place of the SSHD port or the problematic “full-duplex HTTP” transport.

The implementation relies on APIs avalable in the built-in Jetty (“Winstone”) servlet container,
but Jetty APIs are not re-exported to plugins.
JSR 356 is not used on the server side.

== Specification

=== WebSocket service interfaces

A new `jenkins.websocket` package contains an entry point `WebSockets.upgrade`
which issues an HTTP upgrade response and initiates a WebSocket connection.
The service implementor provides a `WebSocketSession` implementation,
which both receives callbacks (for example when a text or binary frame is received)
and can be acted upon (for example to send a frame).

WebSocket ping/pong frames are not explicitly modelled.
Rather, a service can elect to send pings automatically at a fixed interval.
This suffices to keep a connection alive when a proxy server might otherwise have closed it.

=== Inbound agents

An HTTP endpoint `/wsagents/`, implemented by `WebSocketAgents`,
forms the server side of an agent Remoting transport
suitable for use with a computer configured via `JNLPLauncher`.

`hudson.remoting.Engine` correspondingly can make a WebSocket connection to this address
and open the client side of a Remoting transport.
The client is implemented using the JSR 356 API and Project Tyrus library running in standalone mode.

The connection in this mode supports client authentication as well as Remoting protocol capability negotiation.
There is no need to implement any encryption, as this is covered by HTTPS in Jenkins generally.
Some of the complexity of the TCP transport regarding packet framing is also unnecessary, as WebSocket provides this.

Some affiliated APIs such as `JnlpConnectionState` and `JnlpAgentReceiver` may be implemented as time permits.

=== CLI

The Jenkins CLI after the removal of Remoting supported two transports:
SSH and a custom protocol over “full duplex” HTTP.
These could be augmented with a simpler and less problematic WebSocket transport.

== Motivation

=== Reverse proxies, load balancers, and the TCP port

Traditionally, inbound agents (using the somewhat misleadingly-named `JNLPLauncher`)
have connected to a special TCP port in Jenkins handled by `TcpSlaveAgentListener`.
This socket listener handles pluggable ``AgentProtocol``s,
such as `JnlpSlaveAgentProtocol4` with the identifier `JNLP4-connect`
which implements a Remoting transport for agents with TLS encryption support.
If the administrator allows this port to be open (it is a security configuration option),
then agents first make an HTTP metadata request to Jenkins to find the (fixed or random) port number,
and then connect to the TCP port with the desired protocol.

The key problem with this system is not just the use of a secondary port to connect to Jenkins (besides 80/443),
but the fact that the port serves non-HTTP traffic.
If Jenkins is serving traffic directly to all clients (HTTP or not), this is not an issue,
but increasingly these connections are intermediated so as to allow TLS termination or network ingress.
Reverse proxies and L7 load balancers are normally handling HTTP traffic,
and multiplexing by `Host` header or URI path demands it.
Ensuring that connections can be made to an opaque TCP port is often much trickier
and may constrain the choice of proxy software.

(The same issues apply to the SSH port used by some Jenkins features, notably the CLI.
In principle the SSH protocol could support L7 proxies, but this is unlikely.)

When agents are to be connected to a master from outside the LAN,
the Jenkins HTTP(S) URL is already specified;
it is much less hassle if that is the only connection that needs to be routed.

=== Full-duplex HTTP transport

The Jenkins CLI has long been able to run over the HTTP port.
(When Remoting was used, this was offered as an alternative to the TCP port;
after the removal of CLI-over-Remoting, the newer “plain text” protocol runs over HTTP.)

This transport is implemented via the `FullDuplexHttpStream` and `FullDuplexHttpService` APIs in Jenkins,
which effectively simulate a TCP socket using HTTP connections and “chunked” encoding.
Unfortunately this trick stretches the boundaries of acceptable HTTP handler behavior,
and is known to break in certain reverse proxies or otherwise cause complications.
For example, with nginx ingress for Kubernetes, the CLI will not work unless you set the annotation
`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-request-buffering: off`.

== Reasoning

Several alternate approaches to the fundamental problems listed above were explored.

=== JSR 356

Ideally the programmer interface to exposing a WebSocket service would follow JSR 356,
the `javax.websocket` API (particularly `Endpoint`, `Session`, `RemoteEndpoint`, and `MessageHandler`).

After some exploration, however, this appeared difficult to implement in the context of Jenkins.
While Jetty includes an implementation of the JSR,
it is not aligned in any obvious way with the `WebSocketServletFactory` interface
which allows a WebSocket upgrade from an existing servlet HTTP handler,
as would be present at the terminal stage of Stapler routing.

The Jakarta EE-style annotation-based registration (`@ServerEndpoint`) would be acceptable
(at the expense of any integration with Stapler routing),
but merely adding the relevant Jetty modules to the runtime and using such annotations did not work.

Reusing Jetty’s JSR implementation classes (such as `JsrSession`) did not seem feasible,
due to the number of ``@ManagedObject``s involved which would need to be “wired” into place.

Reimplementing JSR interfaces from scratch looked complicated,
and there would be many methods which are not needed for basic use cases
and would have no reasonable implementation based on delegating to what `WebSocketServletFactory` offers.

Project Tyrus offers a “standalone” mode for serving WebSocket connections in an arbitrary Java program.
This is intended to control the entire HTTP port service, however,
and would likely clash with Jetty’s socket management if it worked at all.
Listening on _another_ HTTP port would add too much complexity to the Jenkins installation.

Therefore for now it was decided to keep the implementation simple and use what is known to work:
Jetty’s `WebSocketServletFactory`.
Subsequent research may reveal a straightforward way to use the server mode of JSR 356 from Winstone/Stapler/Jenkins,
in which case the existing Jenkins APIs could be deprecated or amended to link to `javax.websocket`.

=== Exposing Jetty APIs directly

`org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.api` could have been exposed directly to Jenkins code,
assuming Jetty permits this class loader linkage.
However this would tie too much code to Jetty specifics,
and pose problems for users of non-Winstone containers.

=== Extension point for WebSocket services

By analogy with the JSR’s `@ServerEndpoint`,
a Jenkins `ExtensionPoint` could have been defined for each WebSocket-based service.
This would however clash with URIs used by the existing `UnprotectedRootAction` interface
and not allow interoperation with other Stapler features such as hierarchical navigation
or with the standard Jenkins authentication filters.

=== gRPC

link:https://grpc.io/[gRPC] was also considered as a mechanism for bidirectional streaming.
It works at a higher layer than WebSocket, however;
for purposes of a Remoting transport, for example, simple framing suffices,
and there is no need for additional machinery
(Remoting is after all _another_ remote procedure call framework).

The use of HTTP/2 could also be problematic.
It is several years newer than WebSocket,
and likely has poorer compatibility with reverse proxies.

=== Outbound agents

“Outbound” agents, those using any common launcher other than `JNLPLauncher` (such as SSH),
do not suffer from the problem of exposing ports on the Jenkins master.
However, some users have difficulty setting up such agents:

* Installing an SSH server on Windows has traditionally been cumbersome.
* Many administrators have little familiarity with SSH and run into problems with obscure misconfigurations.
* The network hosting the agent computer may not allow inbound connections
  (whereas we presume the network hosting the Jenkins master _does_, since it must serve a web UI).

Note that outbound agents remain a reasonable option for the Jenkinsfile Runner (JFR) scenario,
where you would prefer for the Jenkins “master” to expose no ports.
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-53461[JENKINS-53461]
allows _only_ a TCP port to be exposed (no HTTP), though it would be better to expose neither.

=== Dedicated `ComputerLauncher`

Support for inbound WebSocket connections could be developed as a fresh `ComputerLauncher` implementation.
However, this would fail to reuse a fair amount of subtle code
which is already available in `JNLPLauncher` and the matching client code in `agent.jar`,
such as the `slave-agent.jnlp` endpoint and the secret handling system.
It seems simpler to behave as a mode of `JNLPLauncher` selecting an alternate transport.

== Backwards Compatibility

=== TCP vs. WebSocket selection

A single `agent.jar` can make either TCP or WebSocket inbound connections
via either `hudson.remoting.Main` with `-jnlpUrl` or `hudson.remoting.jnlp.Main`
(along with “outbound” modes typically selected via `hudson.remoting.Main` without `-jnlpUrl`).
Therefore it must be able to decide which to use in a given circumstance:
some servers will support only TCP, some only WebSocket, some both.

One possibility would be to try one transport, then fall back to the other.
Another possibility would be to introduce a new option such as `-websocket`,
meaning the `slave-agent.jnlp` or other launching code must be made aware of the choice.

=== Non-Jetty containers

Jenkins is occasionally run in other servlet containers such as Tomcat
(or even Jetty but not using the built-in Winstone launcher).
WebSocket support will not be offered in these modes,
and dependent features such as WebSocket-based agents will not be available.
There should be no loss of functionality for these users.

(The Jenkins project rarely if ever tests these scenarios and occasionally breaks them inadvertently.
Users are encouraged to run Winstone.
A future JEP may explicitly drop support for custom containers.)

== Security

=== Stapler routing and request authorization

The `WebSockets.upgrade` return value is used as the return value (or throwable) of a regular Stapler web method,
terminating the Stapler handling process.
Thus service implementors are free to use the usual Stapler/Jenkins URI routing techniques
such as `TransientActionFactory` or Java getters.

Regular Jenkins servlet filters also handle request authentication,
and Stapler routing will then follow `AccessControlled` permission checks.
If Jenkins authentication is unwanted (as it is for handling `JNLPLauncher`),
the usual `UnprotectedRootAction` API makes it textually clear that the implementation is opting out of access control.

=== Inbound agent authentication

Inbound agents traditionally have authenticated to a particular Jenkins `SlaveComputer`
by using a secret token (an HMAC of the agent name).
This is necessary since Jenkins lacks service accounts;
otherwise a build machine would need to store the personal API token of a Jenkins user,
which could be abused to perform unrelated actions.

The WebSocket-based agent service retains this system:
the HTTP connection is made anonymously, and the secret is passed in a header.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

=== WebSocket-based agent connections

`WebSocketAgentsTest` provides a functional test demonstrating that the agent can connect to a WebSocket endpoint on localhost.

(The existing `JNLPLauncherTest` continues to test TCP connections using `JNLP4-connect`.)

=== Interactive tests

Several sanity checks were performed of using the WebSocket protocol to set up a bidirectional connection with Jenkins,
or run a (Pipeline) build on an inbound agent,
under complex realistic conditions:

* Against a CloudBees Core installation running on EKS using the nginx ingress controller terminating TLS.
* Against CloudBees Core running on GKE using Google’s native ingress controller based on an external load balancer.
* Against CloudBees Core running on OpenShift 4.2 using a `Route` and TLS termination.

Connecting directly to Jenkins also works.
Other reverse proxies, such as Apache, have not been specifically tested.

Basic connectivity and “keep-alive” behavior can be established using a script such as:

[source,bash]
----
(while :; do date; sleep 5m; done) | websocat -vv wss://$jenkins/wsecho
----

The main finding was that GKE requires minor customization to service definitions to prevent the connection from closing too soon:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jenkins
  annotations:
    beta.cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{"ports": {"80":"jenkins"}}'
type: NodePort
# …
---
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: BackendConfig
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  timeoutSec: 999999
----

and nginx requires a WebSocket ping/pong at less than 60s intervals.
