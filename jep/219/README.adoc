== Abstract

Running Jenkins on Kubernetes cluster is not trivial work. Kubernetes platform was released ten years after first
version of Hudson project. It means Jenkins couldn't be designed to run on top of it.

Jenkins Operator helps to deploy, configure and manage Jenkins on Kubernetes clusters in an immutable, scalable, secure way.

== Specification

This specification describes the problem, and the overall proposed solution,
as it relates to the Jenkins project and existing structures.

The details of the exact behavior and implementation of most areas will be addressed in one or more separate JEPs.

=== Target Audience

Jenkins Operator is targeted at existing and new Jenkins users (system administrators, DevOps engineers or regular programmers)
who are not necessarily interested in becoming Jenkins experts, but rather wish to use Jenkins as a means to an end.
That end being: *building, testing, and delivering their projects*, with as *little overhead* as possible.
Potential users wish to use a stable and reliable CI/CD tool.

Jenkins Operator is going to be the best solution for everybody who is interested in running Jenkins
on Kubernetes cluster.

=== Goals

==== Run Jenkins on top of Kubernetes

Use link:https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework[operator pattern] to manage complex Jenkins stateful
application on top of Kubernetes.

==== Jenkins configuration in one place

Put all information needed to configure Jenkins in a single
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[CRD] Kubernetes resource.

==== Keep Jenkins instance configured

Watch all changes made to Jenkins configuration
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[CR] and apply it to the live
instance.

==== Make Jenkins immutable

Jenkins master instance should be restorable to the desired (configured) state at any point in time.
Any changes made to the Jenkins configuration that are *not* in
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[CR]
should be removed after Jenkins master restart to *avoid snowflake* problem.

==== Scale Jenkins agents

Spawn agents on demand to scale Jenkins workloads.

==== Make default configuration secure

Provide secure configuration as the default option.

==== Make backup of Jenkins build history

Backup Jenkins build history using tools provided by Kubernetes itself and optionally a cloud provider.

==== Make errors more visible for end users

Validate and visualise problems in configuration provided by the user.

==== Reduce Jenkins master unavailability

== Motivation

People who want to run Jenkins on Kubernetes most often use the
link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/jenkins[Jenkins Helm chart] or they build their own custom
distribution themselves.

=== Problems

* no visibility that Jenkins is correctly configured
* no visibility what happens to Jenkins
* plugins management
* Jenkins may not start again after restart(PVC detaching/attaching issue)
* no security by default
* reinventing a wheel(custom distribution)
* lack of tests
* no production ready solution

== Reasoning

link:https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework[Operator pattern] introduced by CoreOS can resolve all
problems mentioned in <<Motivation>> section. This solution gives you the ability to monitor and maintain your Jenkins
state. Kubernetes platforms is a dynamic environment for all applications. The operator can react quickly to any changes
(change of configuration, restart Jenkins). In addition, the operator can apply the configuration to Jenkins without
restarting it.

=== Rejected Alternative Approaches

==== Custom distribution

Custom distribution contains Kubernetes resources and docker image of Jenkins master. In the most cases plugins are
built in a custom docker image. User applies Kubernetes resources via `kubectl` command.

===== Disadvantages

This solution doesn't resolve any problems mentioned in <<Motivation>> section.

==== Helm chart

[quote, taken from https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/]
Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes
resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a
full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on. Charts are created as files laid out in a particular
directory tree, then they can be packaged into versioned archives to be deployed.

===== Disadvantages

* this solution doesn't resolve all problems mentioned in <<Motivation>> section.
* there is a risk that the link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/jenkins[official helm chart] may not
provide all the required features and users are forced to create their own custom distribution which they must maintain
themselves
* helm causes more problems than solves,
link:https://medium.com/virtuslab/think-twice-before-using-helm-25fbb18bc822[Think twice before using Helm]
* change in configuration causes restart of Jenkins master
* restart of Jenkins master causes install new version of plugins(some plugin's feature may stop working)

== Backwards Compatibility

Jenkins Operator is intended to run as an separate program and not require dedicated extension integrated in
jenkins-core. It requires the following plugins installed in Jenkins: kubernetes, workflow-job, workflow-aggregator,
git, job-dsl and configuration-as-code. Users will be able to resolve backwards compatibilities issues by change plugins
versions, Jenkins version or Jenkins Operator version.

=== CRD schema changes

The specific version of Jenkins Operator supports a specific version of the Jenkins configuration saved in the CRD.
Jenkins operator will inform the user of any inconsistencies contained in the CR for the version of the CRD he supports.
Changing the Jenkins CRD configuration version requires changing the Jenkins Operator version.
The migration process from one version to another will require from user to manually rewrite the Jenkins configuration
to the new version and changes to the Jenkins Operator version.

== Security

Every sensitive information will be stored as link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes secrets].
Only Jenkins Operator and Jenkins master will have access to those secrets. Access to secrets will be secured by
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[Kubernetes RBAC policies] and
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/[Kubernetes Service Accounts].
Communication between Jenkins Operator and Jenkins master will be secured using TLS.

== Infrastructure Requirements

The infrastructure dependencies for the `virtuslab/jenkins-operator` image are mostly on
services external to the Jenkins project such as link:https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub].

== Testing

Testing is performed within the context of the existing automated testing in the
link:https://github.com/VirtusLab/jenkins-operator[VirtusLab/jenkins-operator]
repository. This includes the expected amount of unit tests, and end-to-end tests which run Jenkins Operator
and Jenkins on a link:https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube] Kubernetes cluster.
