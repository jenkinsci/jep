== Abstract

Java 11 was released on September 25, 2018.
It is an LTS version with a long support timeline.
Java 8 was released in March 2014.
Java 8 enhancements have stopped as effort focuses on Java 11, Java 17, and beyond.

This Jenkins Enhancement Proposal describes actions required
to make Jenkins end its support of Java 8 and require Java 11 or newer.

== Specification

The specification has been created as a result of a link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/YghQ0YP4m78/m/LO9AFa_GAgAJ[Jenkins developers mailing list discussion].

All stories in this JEP have tickets created in Jira or pull requests in GitHub.
Jira tickets are aggregated in
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67688[JENKINS-67688].

=== Goals and non-goals

Goals:

* Jenkins core development requires Java 11 or newer
* Jenkins plugin development requires Java 11 or newer when the plugin updates its minimum Jenkins core version to one that does not support Java 8

Non-goals:

* Building all components with Java 11
* Jenkins replacing older API calls with Java 11 API calls
** Jakarta EE upgrade is not required as part of this JEP
* All plugins are operational with Java 11
** Some Jenkins components may be updated to support features offered in Java 11 and beyond, but there is no plan to update all tools
* Multi-release JAR support in development tools
* Cleanup of removed or deprecated features

=== Scope of changes

* Jenkins core
* Jenkins remoting
* Jenkins configuration as code
* Docker packaging
* Plugins
* Jenkins website: www.jenkins.io
* Jenkins CI instances:
    link:https://ci.jenkins.io/[ci.jenkins.io],
    infra.ci.jenkins.io,
    trusted.ci.jenkins.io,
    link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/#team[Security team]'s instance
* Maven build flow (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-hpi-plugin[Maven HPI Plugin],
    link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom[Plugin POM],

* User and Developer Documentation

Out of the scope for this JEP:

* Packaging in subprojects (unless specifically noted): Jenkins Operator, Jenkins Evergreen, Jenkinsfile Runner, etc.
  They will be handled in follow-up JEPs if needed.
* Gradle build flow

=== Jenkins core patches

Work to be considered is defined in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67688[JENKINS-67688].

==== Library updates

* The link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67688[JENKINS-67688 epic] will include library updates as needed.
* Some updates may require downstream plugin updates.
* JavaWS support to be removed from remoting - link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/507#issuecomment-1030629619[jenkinsci/remoting#507]

==== Core patches

* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/6083[PR 6083] - Drop Java 8 from Jenkins core
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/6086[PR 6086] - Switch Jenkins acceptance test harness in core to Java 11
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/6092[PR 6092] - Add administrative monitor to remind of upcoming end of Java 8 support

==== Build flow updates

* Jenkinsfile is updated to stop running tests with Java 8
** It includes Unit tests, JTH and ATH smoke tests
* It is possible to build Jenkins Core with the release profile on Java 8

=== Jenkins Docker packaging

The containers tagged for Java 8, like `latest-jdk8` and `centos7-jdk8` will no longer be updated.
The upgrade guide and the announcement blogpost will note that users must switch to other images.
Labels will not be removed for existing containers, but those labels will not be provided for new builds.

Java 8 images will no longer be provided for the controller containers:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins[Controller]

==== Jenkins Agent Images

Java 8 images will no longer be provided for the general purpose agent containers:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/agent[Agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/inbound-agent[Inbound agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/ssh-agent[Outbound (ssh) agent]

Tool specific agent containers will no longer include Java 8:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-docker[Docker agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-golang[Golang agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-maven[Maven agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-node[NodeJS agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-powershell[Powershell agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-python3[Python3 agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-python[Python agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-ruby[Ruby agent]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-terraform[Terraform agent]

The Java 8 dedicated agent image will no longer be updated:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-agent-jdk8[JDK 8 agent]

==== BlueOcean Docker Image

The https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean[Blue Ocean] docker image is no longer used by Jenkins documentation or tutorials.
The BlueOcean containers are already using Java 11.

=== Plugins

No updates are expected to be required in plugins for this JEP.
Plugins compiled with Java 8 are expected to continue running with Jenkins core compiled with Java 11.
Incompatibilities will be reported and tracked as plugin issue reports.

=== New policy: Jenkins core with Java 11

The following policy is suggested:

* Jenkins core components will be compiled with Java 11 and will require Java 11 or later at runtime
* Jenkins plugins that depend on a Jenkins core that requires Java 11 must be compiled with Java 11
** In order to support releases that only run with Java 11, the plugins must use the Maven build flow components that support `java.level` 11

This policy will require changes in the Maven build flow, including:

* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-hpi-plugin[Maven HPI Plugin]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom[Plugin POM]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/pom[Jenkins POM]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/bom[Jenkins plugin bill of materials POM]

=== Rollout plan

The rollout procedure will be coordinated in the link:https://jenkins.io/sigs/platform/[Platform SIG].
Announcements will be sent to multiple Jenkins communication forums, including:

* link:https://www.jenkins.io/node/[Jenkins community blog] - primary announcement and reference
* link:https://twitter.com/jenkinsci[Jenkins twitter]
* link:https://www.linkedin.com/company/jenkins-project[Jenkins LinkedIn]

* A blogpost is provided that announces the change in weekly releases and outlines the steps administrators must take to make the change
** War file installations
** Docker installations
** MSI installations on Windows
** RPM and DEB installations on Linux

==== Issue tracking

* Issues related to Java 8 end of support are tracked as Jenkins issues
** link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67688[JENKINS-67688] is the Jira epic that tracks issues in Jira
** Plugins that use GitHub issues will place a link to their GitHub issue into the Jira epic

==== Post-release support

After the end of Java 8 support in the weekly releases, there may be a number of issues reported by early adopters.
Core maintainers will respond to issue reports as they did for configuration form modernization ("table to div").
A Jira label `java8-end-of-support` will be assigned to issue reports related to Java 8 end of support.

==== LTS Backporting

All backporting will be done according to the link:https://jenkins.io/download/lts/#backporting-process[LTS Backporting Process].

There is no plan to backport changes for the end of Java 8 support to previous LTS baselines.

== Motivation

Java 11 was released on September 25, 2018.
It is an LTS version with a long support timeline.
Java 8 was released in March 2014.
The link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html[Oracle Java SE Support Roadmap] states that premier support for Java 8 ends in March 2022.
Java 8 enhancements have stopped as effort focuses on Java 11, Java 17, and beyond.

Removing support for Java 8 simplifies the supported configurations and allows further modernization of Jenkins core.
Ending support for Java 8 allows Jenkins core and Jenkins plugins to use libraries that support Java 11 but do not support Java 8.

== Reasoning

“Goals and non-goals” section in the specification lists design decisions taken
to ensure it can be delivered by a small team.
Non-goals in the specification are defined to limit the scope of work.
The main objective is to move Jenkins core development to Java 11.
There will be follow-up tasks for further improvements and to adopt new features.

=== Support of Java 17

This JEP intentionally limits its scope by not including Java 17 support.
It does not prevent work on Java 17, but that work is outside the scope of this JEP.

=== Docker image labeling

Docker image labels were updated in August 2021 to use link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2021/08/17/docker-images-use-jdk-11-by-default/[Java 11 by default].
The image labels that do not explicitly mention a Java version (like `latest`, `lts`, `slim`, `alpine`) are already delivering Java 11.

Image labels that explicitly mention `jdk8` will not be updated after Jenkins core ends support for Java 8.

== Backwards Compatibility

The following backward compatibility requirements are defined:

* Jenkins core and updated plugins should fully support Java 11
* Jenkins plugins may continue to compile with Java 8 so long as the plugins run successfully with Java 11
* Jenkins plugins that require a Jenkins version that does not support Java 8 will be expected to compile with Java 11

== Security

=== Process

Only Java 11 with the latest security fixes will be supported at the moment of the first LTS release requiring Java 11.

Jenkins security issues on the release that ends support of Java 8 will be processed according to the
standard link:https://jenkins.io/security/[Jenkins Security Process].

=== Security risks

* No additional security risks are expected due to Jenkins ending support for Java 8

== Infrastructure Requirements

=== ci.jenkins.io

* Tool Infrastructure should continue to offer the latest version of Java 11

=== Jenkins Pipeline Library

* `buildPlugin()`, `runATH()`, and `runPCT()` will run tests with JDK 11

=== DockerHub

* Dockerhub will continue to host container images for Java 11

== Testing

Ending Java 8 support in Jenkins requires significant testing.
Community contributors will be encouraged to test environments and configurations to assure that Jenkins core no longer requires Java 8.

A link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ttjJ7HaUkYMy3L5P8D7w7TddqrUr-1IojtZCukFBQ8/edit?usp=sharing[status reporting document] is ready to track the testing effort.
Testers are welcome to report their results there.

Tests to be performed:

* ATH is updated and successful on Java 11 (**done** in link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/pull/726[ATH PR 726])
* PCT is updated and successful on Java 11
* Plugin bill of materials is updated and successful on Java 11
* Packaging tests are performed successfully on Java 11
* Exploratory tests are performed successfully to check for inadvertent use of Java 8

== Prototype Implementation

Additional prototypes may be evaluated using pull requests or forks of Jenkins core.
Here are links to some of the prototypes include Jenkins core, Docker updates and downstream demo patches.
