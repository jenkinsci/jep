== Abstract

This JEP documents the policy for link:https://www.youtube.com/user/jenkinsci[Jenkins YouTube account] management.
It defines the management approaches and the process for getting management permissions.
This is a process JEP which may be updated in the future.

== Specification

Jenkins YouTube Channel is currently implemented as a user channel.

* URL: https://www.youtube.com/user/jenkinsci

=== YouTube Channel Ownership

Jenkins YouTube account and channel are managed by the
link:https://jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/[Jenkins Infrastructure Team].

=== Roles

Jenkins YouTube channel has the following roles:

* **Manager** - Contributor with the content management permissions
** Action examples: manage events, run broadcasts,
  organize playlists, edit videos, moderate comments, etc.
* **Owner** - Contributor who can manage permissions for others
** Action examples: add/remove channel _Managers_
** Account owners on Jan 10, 2019:
    https://github.com/kohsuke[Kohsuke Kawaguchi],
    https://github.com/rtyler[R. Tyler Croy],
    https://github.com/olblak[Olivier Vernin],
    https://github.com/bitwiseman[Liam Newman]
* **Primary Owner** - Jenkins' Google Account
* **Communications Manager** - This setting allows users to response to feedback but not change videos.
  This is not currently used by the Jenkins project.

=== Account Managers

==== Eligibility

The following categories of contributors are eligible to get **Manager** permissions
in the YouTube channel.

* Jenkins Board members and Jenkins officers (link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Board[list])
* Jenkins Infrastructure Team members
* link:https://jenkins.io/sigs/[Special Interest Group] Leaders
* link:https://jenkins.io/projects/[Sub-project] Leaders

Other Jenkins contributors may also request permissions.
In such case the decision will be made by the YouTube channel owners
depending on the provided justification and the requester's contribution history.

==== Responsibilities

YouTube channel managers are responsible for managing the content they create there.
The responsibilities include but not limited to:

* Run and moderate events within the scope of the request
* Properly categorize videos (descriptions, labels, playlists) so that
  the account can be successfully shared within the Jenkins organization
* Ensure that the content is compliant with the project's link:https://jenkins.io/project/conduct/[Code of Conduct]
* Ensure that the content does not disclose security issues until advisories are published
  (see below)
* Handle video edit requests: amendment, removal of sensitive/private information disclosures, etc.

If a channel manager is not available, YouTube account owners or other channel managers act as a backup.

==== Requirements

* The requester has a Google account (personal or corporate)
  which is clearly mapped to a single person.
  Shared accounts are not permitted
* The Google account has a link:https://www.google.com/landing/2step/[Two-factor authentication] enabled
* The requester has a signed and approved/merged
  link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla#individual-cla[Individual Contributor License Agreement]
* The requested has an account in Jenkins JIRA

==== Requesting permissions

Permissions should be requested by creating a new Jenkins JIRA ticket
(project: *INFRA*, component: *youtube*).
Requests should contain the following information:

* Justification: purpose of the requests with references to the projects/SIGs
* Explicit confirmation that Two-factor authentication is configured for the account

=== Account Owners

Account owner permissions may be granted by the current account owners upon request.
There is no special process for that.

=== Issue management

YouTube Channel issues are managed in the link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins JIRA].

* Project: *INFRA*
* Component: *youtube*

Security-related issues are managed according to the standard
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins Security Process].

== Motivation

With introduction of Special Interest Groups in 2018,
we have started a lot of various meetings.
Some of these meetings are broadcasted via YouTube Live (Hangouts-on-Air)
by a number of contributors who have permissions to manage and run events in YouTube.

Some SIG and sub-project leaders cannot manage events on their own,
because nowadays they have no permissions to create events.
It would be great to document how users get permissions
so that more contributors can run meetings on their own.

== Reasoning

=== Permission request process and requirements

These sections are documented according to the discussion in the Infrastructure mailing list in June 2018.
Thread subject: _Granting YouTube/HoA access to Ewelina and Martin_.

== Backwards Compatibility

N/A, process JEP

== Security

=== Sensitive information

YouTube channel is a potential way of disclosing sensitive information about the Jenkins project.
For example, some security issues may be unintentionally disclosed during the screenshare sessions or recorded discussions.
All channel owners and managers are responsible to ensure that the published materials
do not disclose security issues, personal data or other sensitive information.

In the case of security disclosures (existing or new issues),
owners and managers are responsible to...

* Cleanup the content (e.g. by editing the video recording)
* Report the issue to the Security team (link:https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities[process])

=== Access limitations

Access to the Jenkins YouTube account is limited to a number of contributors.
Additional requirements are set to ensure the limited access (e.g. Two-factor authentication for account managers).

== Infrastructure Requirements

* "youtube" component is created within the Jenkins _INFRA_ project in JIRA
* "youtube" component is created within the Jenkins _SECURITY_ project in JIRA

== Testing

N/A, process JEP

== Prototype Implementation

N/A, process JEP
