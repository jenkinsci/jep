== Abstract

This JEP introduces a new system which enables Jenkins plugin maintainers to add Continuous Delivery (CD) to their projects.
It is:

* Opt-in: plugin maintainers can choose to use this
* Simple to configure: very little needs to be changed in order to enable CD
* Trusted CI/CD: deployments are produced from a single source of truth, which is managed by 
the Jenkins project

== Specification

=== Overview

We'll use a short story to illustrate what it will look like when a plugin maintainer 
named Karl decides that he wants to perform continuous delivery of his (fictional) `karl-plugin`.

To do so, Karl will:

1. Verify support. Karl's plugin is already in the 
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[jenkinsci Organization on GitHub], and is 
using `buildPlugin` when built on ci.jenkins.io.

2. Choose a branch from which to release. Karl decides he wants to release from the `master` branch, 
as that is the simplest.

3. Settle on a version numbering scheme. Karl decides on link:https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

4. Add a file to the top directory of his repository called `Autorelease.yaml`. 

WARNING: *jvz* Couldn't this be done as an argument to buildPlugin()?

5. A webhook is configured on Karl's repository on GitHub to point to a webhook receiver. 

Once ready to create a new release of his plugin, Karl merges some changes to the `master` branch. 
At which point, the following takes place under the covers: 

1. A webhook is sent to a webhook receiver by GitHub

2. The webhook receiver forwards this hook to a trusted CI server, which is protected by a VPN

3. The trusted CI server, upon getting the webhook from the trusted receiver, uses the 
enhanced version of `buildPlugin` to validate the correctness of Karl's `Autorelease.yaml` 
file, and the consistency of Karl's chosen version numbering.

4. Once `Autorelease.yaml` has been validated, a plugin build is performed on the trusted CI server.

5. After the build is successful, the trusted CI server handles deployment of the built plugin to
Artifactory, at which point 
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/README.md[the existing UC generator] 
makes the plugin available on the update center.

=== Detailed Setup

==== Autorelease.yaml

A YAML markerfile, stored in the plugin's own repository. Absence of this markerfile will 
be functionally equivalent to the plugin maintainer opting out of Autorelease. 

In the following example, we'll stick with plugin developer Karl, and his fictional 
plugin `karl-plugin`. Karl's `Autorelease.yaml` file looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: plugin <1>
triggeringBranch: master <2>
versionNumberFields: 3 <3>
----

<1> `kind`
The type of project which is being set up for autorelease. In our first iteration of 
autorelease, this will only be set to `plugin`. The field is here should the Jenkins project 
want to expand the use of autorelease, such as for building core, or components.

<2> `triggeringBranch`
Sets the branch which maintainers will merge to in order to trigger 
an autorelease webhook. Although this is expected to usually be set to `master`, plugin 
maintainers can choose a branch name of their preference, e.g., `autorelease`, `release`, 
etc.

<3> `versionNumberFields`
An integer, indicating the number of fields which `buildPlugin` should expect.
This is important, because sticking to a consistent numbering scheme makes for easier sorting by version.
For this example plugin, Karl has set the value to `3`, because he's usuing semantic versioning, e.g., 
3.1.4.

==== Maven POM file changes

Karl's plugin is already making use of link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/incrementals-tools/blob/master/README.md#usage-in-plugin-poms[Incrementals], and the relevant lines of his `pom.xml` file 
look like:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

        <artifactId>plugin</artifactId>
        <version>4.56</version>
        <relativePath />
    </parent>

    <version>${revision}${changelist}</version>
    <packaging>hpi</packaging>

    <properties>
        <revision>3.1.4</revision>
        <changelist>-SNAPSHOT</changelist>
        <java.level>8</java.level>
        <jenkins.version>2.138.4</jenkins.version>
    </properties>

----

No additional changes need to be made to `pom.xml` by Karl, he's good to go.

==== Autorelease.yaml verification in `buildPlugin`

The commonly used library link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/blob/master/vars/buildPlugin.groovy[`buildPlugin`] will need to be modified to check for the presence of, and validate, `Autorelease.yaml`. This 
markerfile will be the mechanism that tells the trusted CI server that this plugin should be automatically 
released. 

Validation must include, but will not be limited to, the following:

1. `pluginName` field must match the repository name

2. `versionNumberFields` must match the `revision` property in `pom.xml`. E.g., if `versionNumberFields` is 
set to `3` (three fields), and the `revision` in `pom.xml` is set to `3.1.4.5` (four fields), validation 
will fail.

[WARNING]
====
*(bitwiseman)* 
There's a long thread here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/pull/244/files#r293534268 that needs to be integrated into this. 
====

3. Validation that no extra fields are present in the file. Comments are allowed, but any unexpected 
lines will cause validation to fail.

If validation of `Autorelease.yaml` fails for any reason, the build is not performed, nothing gets deployed, 
and GitHub is notified of the failure.

==== Deployment of a successful release

When Karl merges a commit into the `master` branch, that merge commit is link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/305/README.adoc#basic-usage[commit number] 150, and has the 
SHA `1a2b3c4`. The following takes place:

* A webhook is sent from GitHub, to the webhook receiver. That hook is forwarded  to 
the trusted CI server.
* `Autorelease.yaml` is validated.
* Once validation passes, a build is performed. If the build passes all its tests, a release 
is generated. In our example, that release number would be `3.1.4-150-1a2b3c4`
* The built plugin gets deployed to Artifactory
* link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/README.md[The UC generator] makes
the plugin available on the Jenkins Update Center, as Karl Plugin version `3.1.4-150-1a2b3c4`.

WARNING: Some clarification needed based on https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/pull/244/files#r302487016.

== Motivation

At present, Jenkins plugins are, typically, not released on a continous basis. They 
are also not released from a single source of truth, such as a trusted Continuous 
Integration server like link:https://ci.jenkins.io[https://ci.jenkins.io]. 

The notion of continuous delivery of plugin releases has been discussed previously <<footnote-1,^(1)^>>.
Considering that Jenkins is a system used to facilitate Continuous Delivery for many users, it makes 
sense -- and builds credibility -- for the Jenkins developer community to adopt this same practice. 

Having a centralized release system made available to plugin maintainers also provides additional 
confidence that security best practices are being followed. 

Continuous delivery from trusted CI is something which plugin maintainers can opt in to, but is 
not required. If a plugin maintainer chooses to continue to follow their own path for releasing 
versions of their code, they remain free to do so.

== Reasoning

=== What's with the version numbering?

Jenkins plugin maintainers are already familiar with the way that Incrementals appends a commit 
number, plus a SHA, to version numbers. These mechanically-generated version numbers offer 
the ability to predictably sort them, so that external systems, such as the Jenkins update center, 
can correctly publish the "newest" version. The addition of a merge SHA also allows for at-a-glance 
feedback to tell people which commits went into the release.

WARNING: We know the problem of consistent version numbering, and the resulting ability to 
sort versions, is important. The scheme discussed here is only one of several possible 
choices. We expect some _lively debate_ around this topic. But it's very important to ensure 
that versions can be easily sorted by systems such as the Jenkins update center. Also under 
consideration is defining a fixed number of fields in version numbers, and considering any 
deviation from that a validation failure.

=== Why YAML?
YAML is becoming increasingly common in the Jenkins community, for many reasons. YAML is:

* Human readable
* In use by things like the Kubernetes plugin
* Easily parsed by any number of publicly available libraries

=== Webhooks and the Webhook Receiver
Webhooks will be used to trigger the builds on the trusted CI server. Because this trusted CI 
server will reside on a non-public network, there needs to be a proxy server of sorts, which 
can accept these webhooks and send them securely to the trusted CI server.

The hooks themselves will be configured on a per-repository basis. Per-repository hooks 
allow for easier traceability. An organization-wide webhook would send those hooks to the 
receiver far more often than is actually necessary. In the event that something goes wrong 
with this process - the receiver goes down, there is a network outage, etc. - it will be 
easier for the Infra team to triage problems if they're only looking at hooks from plugins 
which are intended to be released via CD.

WARNING: The use of per-repository webhooks versus a single, organization-wide hook, is 
open for discussion. There are good reasons to do it either way.

=== Testing Considerations
Continuous Delivery brings with it a heightened importance for quality automated tests. However, 
there will be no rules governing this. As is the case today, plugin maintainers are encouraged to 
release only well-tested code, but there is little to stop someone from releasing something which 
is under-tested. Continuous delivery does not change this in any way.

=== Aren't we missing some details about infrastructure requirements?

In short, yes, we are. This JEP exists to get the conversation started. Once consensus has been reached, 
a separate Infrastructure Enhancement Proposal (IEP) will be created to go along with this JEP. It would 
be premature to describe every detail of implementation before consensus is reached.

== Backwards Compatibility

Plugin maintainers will need to be mindful of the fact that merging a PR to their `triggeringBranch` 
constitutes a public release. For this reason, the `triggeringBranch` setting in `Autorelease.yaml` can 
be set to something other than `master`, should the maintainer wish to do so.

Continuous delivery introduces no new risks with regard to backwards compatibility of plugins 
themselves. Even without it, there is still nothing stopping a plugin maintainer from releasing 
a backwards-breaking change. 

== Security

Autorelease can help to make Jenkins plugins, and their release processes, more secure in a 
number of ways, including but not limited to:

=== Containment of credentials

By using a single system of record for these builds, a service account, maintained by the 
Jenkins CERT team, can be used to access GitHub, deploy to Nexus, and thus deploy to 
the update centers. Plugin maintainers need not leave their own credentials on a CI server 
which they don't own, and permissions already in place in their GitHub repositories provide 
the required controls over who can merge and release. What's more, they need not have 
Artifactory credentials at all.

=== Automatic enforcement of security best practices
Autorelease builds will all come from a trusted CI server, which resides on a VPN. Rules 
can be put in place on this CI server, which can provide implicit enforcement of the 
Jenkins infrastructure team's security best practices. Compliance to these best practices becomes 
something that plugin maintainers need not worry about.

== Infrastructure Requirements

We will need a number of things to get this going. The low-level technical details will be described 
in a separate Infrastructure Enhancement Request, so, this should be considered a summary for now:

1. The webhook, configured on each participating plugin. Security implications of this are a bit 
beyond the scope of this document so far.
2. [[webhook-receiver]]A receiver for the aforementioned webhook, because the trusted CI 
server will be protected behind a VPN
3. A trusted Jenkins server for performing builds and deployments. 
4. `buildPlugin` will need code added to validate `Autorelease.yaml` for correctness, and 
build the plugin according to the settings described therein
5. Service account(s), managed by the Jenkins Infrastructure team, which provide secure credentials 
to systems such as Artifactory

WARNING: Things such as service accounts and new servers will be documented in a separate IEP.

== Testing

Testing of this process will be performed interactively. The biggest code change involved here 
will be the validation getting added to `buildPlugin`.

== Prototype Implementation

As a proof of concept, the (github-branch-source?) plugin will be the first to adopt. This provides 
the initiative with a heavily used plugin, which sees relatively frequent releases already.

A sample fork of github-branch-source could be provided as a reference implementation for 
this proposal. It is understood that this need not be completed before this JEP is 
"link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/1#accepted[accepted]", but will need to 
be made available before this JEP is given 
"link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/1#final[Final]" status.
