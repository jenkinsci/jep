== Abstract

Integral to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300[Jenkins
Essentials] is the client's update lifecycle with the Evergreen hosted service
layer. Starting with the first boot, the client must frequently inform the
server of its current versions, retrieve new versions, and apply updates. This
document specifies those API interactions and expectations to allow this update
lifecycle to be performed correctly.

== Specification

There are two services involved behind the scenes which are responsible for
facilitating the client's update lifecycle: `updates` and `versions`.

The role of the versions service is simply to maintain an audit trail
for the versions of software that each client has installed locally. As clients
go through various upgrade processes, they will periodically `POST`
<<version-manifest>> records which are stored in the Evergreen hosted service
layer's storage.

The role of the update service is to use the `essentials.yaml` and retrieve the
latest versions of software for a given client UUID and compute the appropriate
update response to be sent to the client.

[[update-levels]]
=== Update Levels

In the backend datastore, updates must be considered immutable and sequential.
These are referred to hereafter as "Update Levels". A single update record
must have the following data structure:

* `id`: Numerical sequential integer to identify the update
* `commit`: a Git commit corresponding to a change of `essentials.yaml` in the
  link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen[jenkins-infra/evergreen]
  repository
* `channel`: String denoting the <<channel>> for the update.
* `manifest`: JSON formatted representation of `essentials.yaml` for ease of
  storage and query in PostgreSQL
* `tainted`: Boolean to indicate whether this update should be considered
  tainted and therefore not offered to clients.
* `createdAt`: Timestamp when this update was created.

For a given <<channel>>, it is expected that each client "experiences" each
Update Level as time goes on, excepting `tainted` records.

in order to track a given update across the different channels, records should
be duplicated between different channels while maintaining the same `commit`.
For example, given an Update Level 1 (UL1) for the 'canary" channel. Once UL1
has been deemed safe to deploy to the next channel, "beta", a new Update record
will be created with all the same information as UL1, with except with a
differing `id` and `channel`. Thus allowing clients to enter a different
channel if desired, without re-installation.

[[channel]]
=== Update Channel

The Update Channel is simply a means of segmenting updates to different types
of clients. For example, testing or "dogfood" infrastructure would reasonably
use a "canary" channel, receiving updates first, before they are added  to
subsequent channels.

The Update Channels are:

* `canary`: bleeding edge updates, initial channel for all updates.
* `beta`: secondary channel for updates after `canary`, recommended for Jenkins
  contributors and other power-users.
* `general`: general use channel, with updates deployed after deemed
  sufficiently stable in previous channels.

While most users should default to the `general` channel, each instance must be
able to select its own channel via a user-supplied argument.


[[update-manifest]]
=== Update Manifest

The responses sent to the client must be well-formed JSON documents, referred
to as "update manifests" which the client must understand.

The Update Manifest
should have a consistent structure which is given to but will be dynamically generated _per
client_ in order to ensure that the client is only downloading what is
necessary to update that specific client.

.Example Update Manifest
[source,json]
----
{
    "schema" : 1,
    "meta" : {
        "level" : 4,
        "channel" : "general"
    },
    "core" : {
        "url" : "https://update-cdn.example.com/some/path/to/a/jenkins.war",
        "checksum" : {
            "type" : "sha256",
            "signature" : "somechecksumforthefile"
        }
    },
    "plugins" : {
        "updates" : [
            {
                "url" : "https://update-cdn.example.com/some/path/to/a/plugin.hpi",
                "checksum" : {
                    "type" : "sha256",
                    "signature" : "somechecksumforthefile"
                }
            },
            {
                "url" : "https://update-cdn.example.com/some/path/to/another/plugin.hpi",
                "checksum" : {
                    "type" : "sha256",
                    "signature" : "somechecksumforthefile"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "client" : {
        "url" : "https://update-cdn.example.com/some/path/to/a/evergreen-client.tar.gz",
        "checksum" : {
            "type" : "sha256",
            "signature" : "somechecksumforthefile"
        }
    }
}
----

The four primary keys of the update manifest are:

* `meta` is an object which contains information about the instance's update
  cycle itself, such as the `channel` and `level`.of the enclosed manifest.
* `core` which indicates that a new jenkins.war is necessary.
* `plugins` which will include a list of `updates` for plugins. This is an
  object within the JSON structure rather than a flat array as it is expected
  that at some point in the future we  may require a `removes` list to properly
  unpublish legacy or out-dated plugins from instances.
* `client` which indicates a new tarball for upgrading the `evergreen-client`
  itself.

Additional keys should be ignored by clients not supporting them to allow the
Update Manifest to safely include things which are not yet supported.

[NOTE]
====
There _may_ be opportunities to cache the Update Manifest in the future, but
this is considered a potential optimization which will be contingent on
observation of real world usage for Jenkins Essentials.
====


==== Checksums

The checksums provided in the Update Manifest are not generated or validated by
Jenkins Essentials but rather the Artifactory instance from which plugin, core,
and other binaries are pulled.

In essence, every `foo-1.2.3.hpi` has a corresponding `foo-1.2.3.hpi.sha256`
file, the contents of which will be included as the checksum in the Update
Manifest to enable clients to perform archive integrity validation.


=== Client Update Behavior

The client must perform the necessary downloading of items referenced in the
<<update-manifest>> and perform checksum validation before initiating a client
update process. The exact sequence of events and what machinery must execute
on the client is considered outside of the scope of this document.

The client should also post a new <<version-manifest>> once an update lifecycle
successfully completed to ensure that subsequent update check-ins result in
accurate generated Update Manifest.

[[version-manifest]]
=== Version Manifest

A version manifest is the symmetrically opposite of the <<update-manifest>> in
that it should include the actual versions of software present on a Jenkins
Essentials instance. This may include software which is outside of the update
lifecycle.

The purpose of the version manifest is primarily for the client
to report to the server a fairly accurate state of the installed software in
the instance.


.Version Manifest
[source,json]
----
{
    "schema" : 1,
    "container" : {
        "commit" : "sha1 of the built container",
        "tools" : {
            "node" : "output of node --version",
            "npm" : "output of npm --version",
            "java"  : "output of java -version"
        }
    },
    "client" : {
        "version" : "version of evergreen-client"
    },
    "jenkins" : {
        "core" : "jenkins.war embedded version",
        "plugins" : {
            "git" : "git.hpi embedded version",
            "workflow-aggregator" : "workflow-aggregator.hpi embedded version"
        }
    }
}
----

The client should also report `container` information, which is informational
rather than critical to the operation of the update lifecycle. This will be
used at a future point in time to better understand the runtime environments
for the Jenkins and evergreen-client processes.


=== Adding new Update Levels

In order for client to receive new <<update-levels>>, an automated backend
process should generating an `ingest.yaml` to be sent to the Evergreen backend
service layer.

==== `ingest.yaml`

The `ingest.yaml` file should be machine-generated from the `essentials.yaml`
with URLs and checksums for artifacts at specific point in time.  This provides
the raw data which the Update service should use to create
<<update-levels>>. The file should be checked into source control and managed
via pull requests and automated changes to allow for thorough testing of the
set time-based snapshot of artifacts.

== Motivation

The motivation for the Jenkins Essentials distribution using this update
lifecycle is largely driven by the goal for Jenkins Essentials to be
self-updating, which necessitates a different approach to code distribution
compared to the conventional Update Center process.


== Reasoning

The design described above is intended to be succinct enough to drive updates
to Jenkins Essentials, of which all instances are expected to be running the
same approximate set of software. Contrasted to the Jenkins "Update Center"
which provides much more metadata to provide user-visible information.

As Jenkins Essentials is intended to update automatically, the metadata
(<<update-manifest>>), only needs to contain the URLs for packages and a
checksum for validation. There are additional <<security>> concerns and
reasoning discussed below.


The Update Levels are a consideration to ensure that clients which have
differing levels of connectivity consistency can be safely updated.
Considering the following problem posed by
link:https://github.com/olblak[Olivier]:

.
[quote]
____
Do you consider all updates as 'safe'?
What happened if a client didn't connect to the update service for month?
Is it an information that would be useful in the update manifest?
____

One of the challenges for Jenkins Essentials is determining how to handle
updates for clients which are not consistently connected. If for example, a
client is only _connected_ to the Evergreen backend services layer once a week
due to network misconfiguration, outages in the Evergreen services layer, or
infrequent internet access, these instances should still be capable of safely
updating their software.

Consider two instances, Alpha and Bravo. They both are created at the same
time, at Update Level (UL) 1. Alpha stays online, and connected, for the next
14 days, while Bravo is disconnected until day 14.

Our state is now:

    Alpha: UL14
    Bravo: UL1

The first idea was to dry to have Bravo jump from UL1 -> UL14 but with Jenkins
Essentials' testing process, this would effectively be a completely untested
upgrade jump. This approach was considered **too risky**.

Another idea which was discussed was to use a git-bisect(1) type approach, trying UL14,
if that fails, try UL7, and so on. This was also discarded as it would result
in instances using completely untested upgrade paths, therefore **too risky**.

(contrary to what the JEP presently describes), and staggar the upgrade logic
Bravo to where it can successfully go from UL1->UL2, then UL2->UL3, etc.


While there ome user experience concerns with downloading updates and
restarting, at the present stage of development, this is considered an
acceptable trade-off, safety rather than performance.



== Backwards Compatibility

Not necessary as there is no pre-existing implementation.

[[security]]
== Security

When considering security for Update Manifests, much of the research which was
considered was around how traditional package managers consider their security
challenges, such as the paper "A Look In the Mirror: Attacks on Package
Managers" footnote:[https://isis.poly.edu/~jcappos/papers/cappos_mirror_ccs_08.pdf]
and the design work done as part of "The Update Framework." footnote:[https://theupdateframework.github.io/]

The two major areas of concern for security with the update lifecycle are
ensuring:

. Update Manifests retrieved by the clients are themselves deemed authentic.
. Packages suggested for the client to download are valid and legitimate.

For Update Manifests to be deemed authentic they must **only** be served over
TLS encrypted HTTP connections. Relying on the
link:https://letsencrypt.org[Let's Encrypt] certificates provisioned for all
`jenkins.io` services.

To provide additional security, and protect against poisoned or fraudulent
`jenkins.io` certificates being used to distribute false Update Manifests, the
Jenkins Essentials container will have a **restricted set of trusted root
certificates**. Trusting only the
link:https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/[root certificates used by Let's
Encrypt], which are presently:

* `DST_Root_CA_X3.crt`
* `IdenTrust_Public_Sector_Root_CA_1.crt`
* `IdenTrust_Commercial_Root_CA_1.crt`

(provided by the `ca-certificates` package on Debian 9 "Stretch")


The second concern is remedied by providing checksums from the distribution site
in the <<update-manifest>>. By ensuring that the client can trust the
authenticity of the Update Manifest, the checksums will be trustworthy even in
cases where the packages themselves are served through a CDN or mirror network.


=== Alternative Approaches

The initial thinking relied on Public Key Pinning (PKP, also referred to as
"pinning leaf certificates") in the client for the Update services. After
cursory amounts of research, it is apparent that this approach is falling out
of favor with leaders in this space such as Chromium
link:https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/he9tr7p3rZ8[moving away from PKP].

==== HTTP-PKP

Another, related approach is referred to as
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469[HTTP-PKP]. Which while it is possible
to implement
link:https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/hpkp-best-practices-if-you-choose-to-implement/4625[HTTP-PKP
with Let's Encrypt] (also see
link:https://lilleengen.io/blog/posts/activating-http-public-key-pinning-hpkp-on-lets-encrypt[this
blog post]). This approach was discarded as unnecessarily complex considering
the client environment which is under control by Jenkins Essentials.

==== GPG key exchange

GPG key exchange is a common approach used by package managers such as Apt and
Yum. This approach was not strongly considered as the tooling for managing GPG
keys from link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js] is lacking, and the use of such keys
would add non-trivial amounts of complexity to the client/server design to
accommodate proper key rotation and revocation.


== Infrastructure Requirements

Nothing additional outside of the existing requirements already for the
Evergreen hosted service layer.


== Testing

Outside of the scope of this document and subject to the implementation linked
below.


== Prototype Implementation

The prototype and _actual_ implementation of this work is being performed in
