== Abstract

Java 11 was released on September 25, 2018.
It is an LTS version with a long support timeline.
This Jenkins Enhancement Proposal describes actions required
to make Java 11 releases publicly available in Weekly and LTS releases.

== Specification

The specification has been created according to the results of the link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/06/08/jenkins-java10-hackathon/[Jenkins and Java 10+ hackathon].

All stories in this JEP have tickets created in JIRA.
Stories are aggregated in
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40689[JENKINS-40689],
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52012[JENKINS-52012] and
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52284[JENKINS-52284].

If the tickets are not linked in the description, they can be found there.
JENKINS-52012 and JENKINS-52284 EPICs are considered as mandatory in this JEP,
JENKINS-40689 - nice to have.

=== Goals and non-goals

Goals:

* Jenkins WAR packages run on Java 8 and Java 11
** Running on Java 11 *may* require extra options, e.g. for loading detached modules.
Although we have a plan for some cases (java.xml.bind for JAXB), there may be other modules requiring updates
* Jenkins on Java 11 is fully supported
* No big bang
** The most of core and plugin patches will be delivered in Weekly releases ahead of the Java 11 general availability announcements
** We will be landing these patches using the existing code review process and test automation flows
* Jenkins on Java 11 is available in the preview mode
** It may be fully supported if this JEP is implemented after its release.
Otherwise a separate JEP will be submitted for Java 11 support

Non-goals:

* Jenkins is fully clean from “Illegal Reflective Access” warnings
** There are many known places where Jenkins prints warnings about Illegal reflective access
(see link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40689[JENKINS-40689])
** We acknowledge the problem, but we do not consider it as a blocker for a release with Java 11 support.
By default OpenJDK 11 just prints a warning once on the startup, there is no short-term plan to change this behavior in OpenJDK
* All plugins are operational with Java 11
* Building all components with OpenJDK 11
** Some Jenkins components may be updated to support features offered in Java 9+, but there is no plan to update all tools
* Full multi-release JARs support in Development tools
* Cleanup of removed/deprecated features.
** During Jenkins & Java 10+ Hackathon we have discovered several stories, which may impact Jenkins behavior on future versions:
*** Signal API is deprecated (JENKINS-51995)
*** Java Web Start is removed from Java 10+ (JENKINS-50301)
*** …
* There is no plan to remove all functionality as a part of this JEP, but it may be done and included into the release

=== Scope of changes

* Jenkins Core
* Jenkins Docker Packaging
* Plugins
* jenkins.io
* ci.jenkins.io

=== Jenkins core patches

Must-have stories are defined in link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52012[JENKINS-52012].
All stories in this EPIC need to be completed.

==== Library updates

* The JENKINS-52012 EPIC includes a number of library updates in the core we know about: Groovy, ASM, etc.
* Some updates may require downstream plugin updates.
** For Example, Groovy update requires cleanup of the Metaspace leak memory in Script Security and Pipeline plugins

==== Core patches

* Jenkins JNLPLauncher built-in documentation will be updated to indicate that Java Web Start feature is not available in Java 10+
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/tree/java11 is merged into master and deleted
* Extras Executable WAR patch to permit running with Java 11 is permitted without the “--enable-future-java” flag (JENKINS-52285)

==== Build flow updates (JENKINS-51903)

* Jenkinsfile is updated to run tests with JDK 11
** It includes Unit tests, JTH and ATH smoke tests
* It is possible to build Jenkins Core with the release profile on JDK 8
* Dockerfile images are migrated

==== Plan for other Java 11 patches

There is a number of pending patches and tickets (e.g. detaching of JNA/JNR API, Lib Process Utils Patch, etc.),
which cleanup Illegal Reflective Access attempts in Jenkins.

* These patches will be reviewed and integrated into weekly releases once ready
* These patches do not block the Java 11 GA release

The patches will be tracked in the
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40689[JENKINS-40689] EPIC.

=== Jenkins Docker packaging

==== Jenkins Master Images (JENKINS-51985)

* Official jenkins/jenkins image is available for Java 11. Suggested labels:
** latest-jdk11
** latest-alpine-jdk11
** latest-slim-jdk11
** VERSION-jdk11
** …
* Automatic build flow on Trusted CI is updated to build and release images. Weekly and LTS releases are performed automatically
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/tree/java11 experimental branch is integrated into the master branch and deleted to avoid confusion.

==== Jenkins Agent Images (JENKINS-52279, JENKINS-51986)

* https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-slave, https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-ssh-slave and https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-jnlp-slave are updated to offer JDK 10 builds
** Version format is to be determined by the image maintainers
* DockerHub configurations are updated to automatically build images

==== BlueOcean Docker Image (JENKINS-52280)

* BlueOcean build for Java 11 should be made a part of the build/release flow for the component
* It can be done after the GA release

=== Plugins

link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52012[JENKINS-52012] tracks updates required in plugins.
There are the following conditions for the GA release:

* All plugins pass ATH with JDK 11
* All known issues are documented in the Java 11 Compatibility Issues Wiki page (see below)
* Plugin updates are mentioned in upgrade guidelines

Currently we know about 2 plugins which will need to be updated: “Pipeline: Support” plugin (JENKINS-52187), Monitoring Plugin (JENKINS-52092).
More plugin compatibility issues may be discovered during testing.

=== New policy: Building with JDK 11

The following policy is suggested:

* Allow requiring JDK 11 to build Jenkins components
** It includes Jenkins core libs, plugins and potentially the core itself
** It is up to maintainers to decide when they are ready to accept such requirement in components they maintain
* Require such components to retain compatibility with Java 8 (as long as Jenkins Core supports it)
* Require such components to have Jenkinsfiles running tests on Java 8 and Java 10+
* Be explicit that all Java 10+ support is available in the experimental mode until Jenkins officially supports it
(currently we consider Java 10/11 support as a preview mode - docs)
* if a downstream component includes Java 9+ bits (e.g. lib-process-utils),
downstream components (e.g. Jenkins core for lib-process-utils) must be still buildable and testable with JDK8

This policy may require patches in parent POMs:

* 2 Parent POMs should be updated: Jenkins POM and Plugin POM
* For known issues Maven plugin versions should be updated to versions compatible with JDK10+. Support of JDK 8 is a must (see “Building with JDK 10+”)
* If builds on Java 11 work correctly after the patches, support of JDK 11 can be released for tools

=== Rollout plan

The rollout procedure should be coordinated within the link:https://jenkins.io/sigs/platform/[Platform SIG].

==== Timeline

* Experimental Java 11 Support is available in Jenkins 2.127 +
** We have started integrating some patches starting from 2.127 when the “--enable-future-java” flag was introduced
* This JEP targets Java 11 support in weekly releases.
The plan is to announce Java 11 support when it is done, no special timing
* LTS general availability: Java 11 support will be available in LTS once the LTS baseline updates to the Weekly release.
** There is no plan to backport changes required for Java 11 support

==== Website

* link:https://jenkins.io/doc/administration/requirements/java/[Java Support Page] is updated to indicate that Java 11 is supported
* link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/06/17/running-jenkins-with-java10-11/[“Running Jenkins with Java 10 and 11”] blogpost is updated to refer the new guidelines
* For Java 11 the website should be updated only after the official release of OpenJDK 11
* There is an announcement blogpost for Java 11 support general availability in weekly
** The blogpost will include upgrade guidelines, “make a backup” will one of the required steps there
* There is an announcement blogpost for Java 11 support general availability in LTS

==== Wiki

* There is a Wiki page created to track known Java 11 incompatibilities in the Jenkins Core and Plugins.
* The page will have format similar to link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+fix+for+JEP-200[Plugins affected by fix for JEP-200] Wiki

==== Post-release support

After the release of Java 11 support, there may be a number of defects created by early adopters.
It may cause additional workload on plugin and core maintainers, and this JEP sets sets a requirement to assist with triage of issues after the release.

After the weekly release availability the JEP sponsor (or a group of people nominated by him, “Java 11 Maintainers”)
will be responsible to provide an extra support for the issues:

* Java 11 Maintainers will periodically review open defects and triage them (e.g. once per week)
* Java 11 Maintainers may request additional information from the reporter. Finally, they are expected to communicate the triage outcome.
* Possible triage outcomes:
** Accepted by Java 11 Maintainers. In such case one of maintainers assigns the issue to himself and delivers the fix
** Rejected by Java 11 Maintainers - functional defect in the plugin (e.g. reliance on Java version or private fields in Reflections) or lack of justification for a fix
** Issue is closed - Not a defect, Duplicate, etc.
* For accepted issues maintainers will prioritize and schedule the fix
** Java 11 support is considered as a “Feature” with an obvious workaround: “Downgrade to Java 8”
** Fixes for Java 11 will be prioritized by the team, but incompatibilities won’t be considered as Blocker issues if downgrade is possible
* Issues rejected by Java 11 maintainers will be assigned to component leads in JIRA (if any).

The proposed support model will be in place until “Availability in LTS + 2 months”.
After this period Jenkins component maintainers will be responsible for triaging and fixing issues in their components.
SECURITY reports will be triaged by Jenkins Security Team.

== Motivation

In September 2018 we expect Java 11 to be released.
It is an LTS version with a long support timeline.
Over last year Jenkins project has been receiving many issue reports about Java 9 and then Java 10 compatibility.

* During Jenkins World 2017 hackfest Mark Waite and Baptiste Mathus invested
some time to explore Jenkins compatibility with Java 9
* In link:https://jenkins.io/changelog/#v2.111[Jenkins 2.111] we had to
prevent Jenkins from starting up on unsupported Java versions toprevent false expectations from users.
* In link:https://jenkins.io/changelog/#v2.127[Jenkins 2.127] we partially re-enabled
the behavior by offering a new `--enable-future-java` which allowed running with Java 9 and above
* Before the link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/06/08/jenkins-java10-hackathon/[Jenkins & Java 10+ Hackathon]
we offered preview versions of Jenkins on Java 10 and 11
(link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/06/17/running-jenkins-with-java10-11/[run guidelines])
* During the hackathon we were able to get major Jenkins features running
with Java 10 and 11.
See the summary link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hWWa6mYv86Kn8Ulu7uGlRJ9h2XTHlvHolO9CeRnnvcI/edit#slide=id.g1a6800f862_0_0[here]
* We did progress w.r.t Java 11 during the DevOps World | Jenkins World 2018 hackathon,
  key issues like Pipeline metaspace leaks are addressed

//TODO: replace summary by the blogpost

Taking the success of the Jenkins and Java 10+ hackathon,
there is an interest to continue working on these stories towards making
Java 11 support available in Jenkins releases (weekly and then LTS).

== Reasoning

“Goals and non-goals” section in the specification lists design decisions taken
to ensure it can be delivered by a small team.
Non-goals in the specification are defined to limit the scope of work.
The main objective is to get Jenkins running with Java 11,
there will be follow-up tasks to cleanup Illegal Reflective Access warnings and to adopt new features.

More reasoning will be added to this section according to the feedback.

== Backwards Compatibility

The following backward compatibility requirements are defined:

* Jenkins Core and Updated plugins should fully support JDK 8
* In the case of compatibility issues, it is possible to migrate from Java 11 to Java 8 by replacing Java in PATH or by replacing the official Docker image
** Java 8 and Java 11 XML formats are similar

== Security

* Only Java 11 with the latest security fixes will be supported at the moment of the public release
* In particular cases Java 11 may introduce new security defect
(e.g. Groovy Sandbox escaping in Script Security plugin)
** In order to mitigate this risk, Groovy will not be updated to 3.x in the incoming GA release.
It means that Java 9+-alike features will not be available in Groovy DSLs within Jenkins
** If a security issue is reported, is will be handled with a high priority by “Java 11 Maintainers” (see below)

== Infrastructure Requirements

=== ci.jenkins.io

* Tool Infrastructure should offer the latest version of JDK 11 (pre-release one) - INFRA-1688 .
* JDK 11 should be added to `ci.jenkins.io`

=== Jenkins Pipeline Library

* `buildPlugin()`, `runATH()`, and `runPCT()` should support running tests with JDK 11 (
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-1690[INFRA-1690],
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-1691[INFRA-1691],
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-1692[INFRA-1692])
* It is possible to do fine-grain configurations in `buildPlugin()`,
so we do not run Java 11 tests on core versions which do not support it
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-1687[INFRA-1687])
* essentialsTest() should support defining Java version matrix for testing
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-1693[INFRA-1693])

=== DockerHub

* CD Flow for JDK 11 images is updated to support the Master branch with Java 11 packages
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-1694[INFRA-1694])

== Testing

Java 11 support in Jenkins requires a serious amount of testing.
During link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/06/08/jenkins-java10-hackathon/[Jenkins and Java 10+ hackathon] there was a significant amount of exploratory testing performed,
and after several patches there was no major issues discovered.
More tests should be performed.

In order to track the testing effort, a status Google doc has been created:
link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oluVrNVpQhXCIwW9CYVm09Y1vPc3H77d3q92LrzcpDw/edit[here].
Testers are welcome to report their results there.

Tests to be performed:

* ATH is performed on Java 11
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52309[JENKINS-52309])
* BlueOcean ATH is performed with Java 11
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52310[JENKINS-52310])
* PCT is performed on Java 11, at least for the recommended plugins
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52312[JENKINS-52312])

== Prototype Implementation

Prototype implementation has been created during Jenkins & Java 10+ hackathon. There is no plans to create additional prototypes.
These prototypes include Jenkins core, Docker updates and downstream demo patches.
