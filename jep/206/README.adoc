== Abstract

All Jenkins Pipeline build logs are stored internally in UTF-8 encoding.
(The log can be seen by users from the *Console* link,
but also from Blue Ocean, *Pipeline Steps*, and REST and CLI.)

Text produced by Jenkins (Java) code is intrinsically Unicode.
Output from external processes which was not already in UTF-8 is converted to UTF-8 as it is produced.

The scope does not include other project types (freestyle),
or other types of logging (system, branch indexing).

== Specification

Newly created Pipeline build logs use UTF-8 encoding for all text.
This is hard-coded in the `charset` field in `build.xml`.
The `TaskListener` associated with the build as a whole (`FlowExecutionOwner.getListener`),
and with individual steps (`StepContext.get(TaskListener.class)`),
will thus be using UTF-8 encoding.

When output is produced by `DurableTaskStep` (`sh`, `bat`, `powershell`),
it is transcoded to UTF-8 where necessary by `FileMonitoringController`.
The API methods `charset` and `defaultCharset` in the `DurableTask` interface support this.
The source encoding defaults to the system default encoding of the node (`Charset.defaultCharset`),
but may be explicitly specified with a `encoding` parameter.

== Motivation

Jenkins freestyle build records retain a character encoding field `charset`,
which may vary from build to build.
Since a freestyle build always allocates exactly one node,
the encoding is just the system default encoding of that node,
and the build log is understood to use that encoding.
Output from build steps (external processes)
is copied directly to the build log as a bytestream.
Content rendered over HTTP is always sent in UTF-8 encoding.

When Pipeline was introduced,
this system could not applied as is
since a Pipeline build could use many nodes, or none.
The build log was just left in the _master_’s system default encoding;
if that encoding happens to be identical to that used by an agent,
then process output will be encoded directly.
Otherwise you get
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake[mojibake]:
garbled text caused by bytes being interpreted as the wrong characters.

Pipeline also suffered from a problem that continues to affect freestyle builds:
non-ASCII text sent directly by Java code into the build log
(for example, `Folder Name » Job Name`)
may or may not be displayable,
according to the capacity of the build log encoding.

This proposal solves such issues,
and simplifies development and debugging generally,
by forcing every Pipeline build log to be in UTF-8 encoding.

== Reasoning

=== Expanding scope to freestyle builds

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/3231[Jenkins PR 3231]
proposes switching everything in Jenkins core to UTF-8.
The proposed change is far from complete, however;
notably, it does not address encoding of build step output.

This JEP does not attempt to solve those issues,
but neither does it preclude or impede their solution.
The bulk of the work here involves the `durable-task` plugin
which is not used by freestyle builds.

=== Transcoding of process output from `Launcher`

Non-durable task output from external processes
(using the core `Launcher` interface, such as `checkout` using CLI Git)
is not transcoded.
If the process produces non-ASCII, non-UTF-8 output,
and the process output is streamed to the build log,
this could result in mojibake in the log.

This likely needs to be addressed in Jenkins core
by having `ProcStarter.stdout(Listener)` transcode as needed.
In practice only a small amount of text sent to Pipeline build logs is produced this way,
and it is particularly unlikely to be produced by user-controlled inputs
and thus to contain any non-ASCII characters.

Due to the low priority, this JEP does not currently attempt to fix this core issue.
Addressing it _may_ help apply UTF-8 to freestyle build logs in the future.

=== Default value for `DurableTaskStep.encoding`

The historical default for `encoding` parameter to `sh` and similar steps was UTF-8.
This did not match the default for `readFile` and `writeFile`,
and anyway did not apply to output streamed to the build log
(only to the `returnStdout` option).

Retaining this default would improve compatibility in only limited circumstances,
at the expense of doing the wrong thing in typical situations
where a process is printing text in the system default encoding.

=== Use of agent system default encoding

As noted in the historical section,
it is impossible for Pipeline builds to follow the same policy as freestyle builds
of using the same encoding as the agent system default for the build log:
there may be multiple agents in use, or none,
and the particular agent(s) used are not even known when the build starts.

=== Use of historical non-Unicode encodings

Some users speaking non-English languages, particularly with non-Latin scripts,
may prefer to work exclusively with text documents in a traditional encoding.
This seems to be particularly commonplace in Japan.
@kohsuke (pers. comm.) has mentioned this concern in the past.

Since build logs were already rendered in UTF-8 via HTTP,
the internal coding system should really only matter
to users accessing the `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/…/builds/…/log` file directly.
While that may have been common in the early days of Hudson,
this is likely a rare use case today.

In any event, making Jenkins architecture more complex and potentially buggy
to satisfy a marginal requirement seems a poor trade-off.

== Backwards Compatibility

Jenkins clusters running on computers with UTF-8 set as the system encoding
(including typical modern Linux installations)
should see no change in behavior.

When the computers hosting Jenkins master and/or agent processes
have a different system encoding
(typical on Windows servers for example),
there _may_ be compatibility issues as described below.

Of course where the contents of build logs were exclusively ASCII to begin with,
none of this matters.

=== Historical builds

Historical builds may have recorded a different `charset` in `build.xml`.
In such a case, their log text will continue to be served in that encoding.

If the build was started before the upgrade but is still running,
it will continue to use the recorded encoding.
That may mean that newly produced text contains mojibake.

=== Partial updates

If the Jenkins administrator updates one of `workflow-job` or `workflow-durable-task-step`,
but not the other,
there is a possibility of mojibake in log output when non-ASCII text is printed.

The fix is simply to update both plugins.
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-49651[JENKINS-49651]
could be used to enforce that.)

=== Default encoding of durable tasks

If a Pipeline script was running a durable task with no explicit `encoding`,
there is a possibility of mojibake being _introduced_ by the update.
This should only happen under some fairly specialized conditions.

The fix is to specify the `encoding` parameter explicitly.

== Security

There are no security risks related to this proposal.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

New test code in `workflow-job` verifies overall behavior.

Test code in `durable-task` verifies all modes of transcoding in detail,
using a Dockerized agent with ISO-8859-1 encoding.
Shorter test code in `workflow-durable-task-step` checks the integration into the actual Pipeline step.

Existing test code in `workflow-support` fails as expected,
pending plugin releases allowing a cyclic dependency to be broken.

== Prototype Implementation

The change is contained in four pull requests to Pipeline plugins, as listed below.
