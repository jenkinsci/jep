== Abstract

We often describe Jenkins using the metaphor of lego bricks which can be pieced
together by the end-user in order to solve their problems. Borrowing that metaphor,
Jenkins Essentials provides the end-user with a
pre-assembled collection of legos that can be immediately used to implement CI
footnoteref:[ci, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration]
and CD
footnoteref:[cd, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery] workloads.
At the same time, this focus on end-users success in these well-defined scenarios
will help the Jenkins project develop new features, and fix
bugs, more rapidly than before.


== Specification

Jenkins Essentials covers an ambitious scope which is more thoroughly
detailed in subsequent JEP footnoteref:[jep,
https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/1#jep-1-jenkins-enhancement-proposal-format]
documents in this series. This specification describes the problem, and
overall proposed solution, as it relates to the Jenkins project and existing
structures.

[[target-audience]]
=== Target Audience

Jenkins Essentials is targeted at existing and new Jenkins users who are
not necessarily interested in becoming Jenkins experts,
but rather wish to use Jenkins as a means to and end.
That end being: building, testing, and
delivering their projects, with as little overhead as possible.

Jenkins Essentials is not going to be an ideal solution
for _everybody_ who is interested in Jenkins. It is expected that some number
of users will continue to "build their own" Jenkins environment, cobbling
together a core `.war` and the specific set of plugins which meet their desired
goals.


=== Pillars

The pillars to Jenkins Essentials will be described in more detail in future
documents but this section provides an overview of the four core aspects of
Jenkins Essentials which, taken together, will address the problems facing the
<<target-audience>>.


[[auto-update]]
==== Automatically Updated Distribution

In order to provide an easier-to-use and easier-to-manage Jenkins environment,
Jenkins Essentials will be distributed as an automatically self-updating
distribution, containing Jenkins core and a version-locked set of plugins considered "essential."
Rather than attempting to mirror the existing Weekly and LTS release lines for core, plus
some plugin version matrix, Jenkins Essentials will update in a manner similar
to Google Chrome.
footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#Release_channels,_cycles_and_updates]

For Jenkins end-users, this automatically updating distribution will
mean that Jenkins Essentials will require significantly less overhead to manage,
receiving improvements and bug fixes without any user involvement. From the user
perspective, their Jenkins will appear to automatically improve over time.

For Jenkins project developers, this approach introduces multiple improvements:

. Greatly reduced time between core and "foundational" plugin changes landing,
  and being adoptable by downstream components.
. Greatly reduced version matrix for testing core/plugin changes against one another.
. Small-batch changes, automatically distributed to Jenkins instances which are
  inherently more <<connected>>, can can automatically report success/error
  telemetry, providing rapid feedback for changes. This feedback mechanism,
  rather than relying on end-users to manually upgrade, notice potential
  issues, and file tickets in JIRA, when coupled with an automatically updating
  distribution allows for rapodily backing out changes which may cause problems
  for users.
  
The components responsible for this automatically self-updating distribution will be referred
to as the "Evergreen" distribution system, and will be described further in subsequent JEP documents.

[[sane-defaults]]
==== Automatic Sane Defaults

Providing a core along with "essential" plugins is a good first step to helping
Jenkins users successfully automate their CI/CD workloads, but requires
additional "smoothing" over some of the numerous options and configurations
plugins.

This will take numerous forms, including but not limited to:

. Refactoring in "essential" plugins to identify shared configuration
  opportunities. For example, numerous plugins benefit from the use of a GitHub
  authentication credential, yet Blue Ocean, GitHub Branch Source, and GitHub
  OAuth all have slightly different  views on where and how these credentials
  should be stored.
. Scripting (`init.groovy.d/`) environmental-driven defaults, such as
  detecting Docker or Cloud support which can be automatically configured, etc.

[[connected]]
==== Connected

In order to provide a more seamless experience for end-users, and ensure that
Jenkins project developers receive useful error and usage telemetry to drive
further improvements in Jenkins, Jenkins Essentials must necessarily be viewed
as a "Connected" application. This entails some yet-to-be-specified number of
server-side applications to coordinate updates, receive and process telemetry,
broker 3rd-party service authentications, relay webhooks, etc.

[[obvious-path]]
==== Obvious Path to User Success

The final pillar in Jenkins Essentials, is to ensure that Jenkins provides an
obvious path for a user to configure and use it successfully. This largely
entails in-application documentation, examples, and disabling legacy
functionality within the application. All with the end goal of preventing users
from inadvertently choosing legacy, or poorly supported, options when
configuring their CI/CD workloads.


== Motivation

The "bucket of legos" approach is one of the numerous reasons why Jenkins has
reached its current level of popularity and adoption, thereby allowing savvy
users to create an solution customized to their needs. This approach is not
productive or useful for end-users
footnote:[https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ContinuousIntegration]
who are weighing their options between running Jenkins, or using a
CI-as-a-Service offering such as Travis CI or Circle CI.

Additionally, existing processes around "Suggested Plugins", or any
others for that matter, result in many "fiefdoms" of development rather than a
shared understanding of problems and solutions which should be addressed to
make new, and existing, users successful with Jenkins.

=== Problem

For novice-to-intermediate users, the time necessary to prepare a Jenkins
environment "from scratch" into something productive for common CI/CD
workloads, can span from hours to days, depending on their understanding of
Jenkins and it's related technologies. The preparation of the
environment can also be very error prone and require significant on-going
maintenance overhead in order to continue to stay up-to-date, secure, and
productive.

Additionally, many Jenkins users suffer from a paradox of choice
footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice] when it comes to
deciding which plugins should be combined, in which ways, and how they should
be configured, in order to construct a suitable CI/CD environment for their
projects. While this is related to the problem which JEP-2
footnoteref:[jep2, https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/2#jep-2-criteria-for-selecting-suggested-plugins]
attempted to address in the "Setup Wizard" introduced in Jenkins 2.0, Jenkins
Essentials aims to address the broader problem of providing users with a
low-overhead, easily maintained, and solid distribution of common features
(provided by a set of existing plugins) which will help the user focus on
building, testing, and delivering their projects rather than maintaining
Jenkins.


==== Inside the Project

Within the Jenkins project there is little organizational overlap between those
common installed, arguably "required", plugins and their developers. This same
gap exists, to a certain extent, between core and the extended plugin developer
community.
This results in:

* Configuration redundancies, such as the Configure System page entries for
  "GitHub" (provided by link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github[GitHub]) and
  "GitHub Enterprise Servers" (provided by
  link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source[GitHub Branch Source]).
* User-success isolation, that is to say, dependent plugins which are many
  layers away how users are interacting with Jenkins, may never get useful
  feedback on how their code is being exercised. This can lead to costly
  rewrites and refactoring, such as that done with SCM API v2.
  footnote:[https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/01/17/scm-api-2/]
* Slow adoption of new, or planned, core changes in plugins, causing significant amounts of
  testing workloads in order to successfully make significant improvements to
  Jenkins core. footnote:[https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/01/13/jep-200/]





== Reasoning

=== Mission and Priority Specification

This document does not  propose a _specific_ design or implementation, as other JEPs might.
This is intentional.
Later JEPs in this series will will address design and implementation.
This document specifies the concept of "Jenkins Essentials" and the mission and priorities
of the Jenkins Essentials project.
Limiting the scope of this JEP to high-level goals will let us build
a solid consensus for that direction before we begin working on individual features.
Having a unified plan as we begin is vital to addressing the "User-success isolation"
mentioned in the <<Motivation>> section.


=== Alternative Approaches

The first foray into this problem domain with
"Suggested Plugins" footnoteref:[jep2] resulted in a tremendous increase in
installations of plugins which had been deemed "useful." The "Suggested
Plugins" approach has failed to make significant changes in user success.

For example, Jenkins 2.0 significantly emphasized
link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins Pipeline] however,
at the time of this document's writing the anonymous usage statistics indicate
over 10 million Freestyle Jobs, compared to just over 2 million Pipelines
footnote:[December 2017 stats, 10991962 Freestyle, 2029622 Pipeline]
after 20 months since 2.0 has been released, and over 3 years since Pipeline
was first introduced.
footnote:[https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/82e7defa37c05c5f004f1ba01c93df61ea7868a5/CHANGES.md]
Simply providing an end-user a smaller set of choices (plugins) still requires
the end-user to configure and utilize them correctly to solve their problems.

The underlying problem remains unsolved, to this end the pillars of
<<sane-defaults>> and <<obvious-path>> aim to ensure that users are able to
rapidly adopt features provided by "essential" plugins to successfully solve
their problems.

By channeling this work through the <<auto-update>>, Jenkins Essentials aims to
cross some of the organizational boundaries currently present in the Jenkins
project, as is necessary to provide a more cohesive solution for end-users.

Plainly stated, Jenkins Essentials means: the whole is greater than the sum of
its parts.

==== Suggested Plugins

As mentioned earlier, the "Suggested Plugins" functionality in the "Setup
Wizard" might be considered an alternate approach which has been implemented in
Jenkins. Expanding on this functionality had been considered, but without
the support from an <<auto-update>> it's highly unlikely that this approach
would result significant benefits to developers or end-users that would help
cross some of the existing organizational boundaries.

==== CloudBees Assurance Program

Another approach suggested by colleagues at
link:https://cloudbees.com[CloudBees] was to emulate the "CloudBees Assurance
Program."
footnote:[https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-documentation/assurance-program/]
This would entail creating a form of "LTS for Plugins" which meet some quality
criteria bar. This idea was swiftly rejected as the maintenance burden on a
core LTS alone is significant. Additionally, an "LTS for Plugins" would not
necessarily be useful for the <<target-audience>> of users who wish to "get
stuff done" but would rather provide more benefit to long-lived, slower moving,
Jenkins environments which are likely already being serviced by experienced
administrators or solutions providers.


== Backwards Compatibility

There are no anticipated backwards compatibility issues to discuss in this
document. Future enhancements to plugins under the guise of Jenkins Essentials
may make backwards incompatible changes, and thereby require new core version
dependencies in their `pom.xml`.


== Security

There are no inherent security impacts to discuss in this document, another
document related to Jenkins Essentials will discuss a proposed process for
handling link:https://jenkins.io/security/[Security (CERT)] advisories and
updates.


== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no infrastructure requirements to discuss in this document,
additional documents which propose new service-oriented functionality will
however have infrastructure requirements documented in each proposal.


== Testing

There are no testing issues related to this proposal.

== Prototype Implementation

[TIP]
====
Link to any open source reference implementation of code changes for this proposal.
The reference implementation need not be completed before the JEP is <<accepted>>,
but must be completed before any JEP is given "Final" status.
JEPs which will not include code changes may omit this section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When moving this JEP from a Draft to "Accepted" or "Final" state,
include links to the pull requests and mailing list discussions which were involved in the process.
