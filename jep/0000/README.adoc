== Abstract

Java releases are link:https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/moving-the-jdk-to-a-two-year-lts-cadence[delivered every 6 months] with a long term support release (LTS) link:https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-long-term-support-lts[every two years].
link:https://adoptium.net/support/[Eclipse Temurin] and link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013[OpenJDK from Red Hat] both support their Java long term support releases with security patches for six years.

This JEP describes a 2+2+2 support plan where Jenkins supports a new Java LTS in the first two years after its release, then requires that Java LTS as its minimum Java version in the next two years of its support, then drops support of that Java LTS in the last two years.
The 2+2+2 support plan reduces maintenance effort on older Java releases and is more likely to attract developers.

The Jenkins project will be better able to plan releases, welcome new users, and support existing users with the 2+2+2 Java support plan.

// See the link:https://medium.com/@javachampions/java-is-still-free-3-0-0-ocrt-2021-bca75c88d23b[Java is still free 3.0.0 (Oct 2021) blog post] for details of Java licensing and OpenJDK distributions.

== Specification

The two year Java release cadence with a six year support life means that three Java LTS releases are officially supported at any point in time by Eclipse Temurin and OpenJDK.
Jenkins developers want to support two Java LTS releases rather than three in order to improve and simplify Jenkins with the latest Java capabilities and to reduce maintenance overhead associated with older Java releases.

=== Support cadence

In order to limit Java support to two LTS releases, the Jenkins project uses a 2+2+2 Java support plan.

A new Java LTS release is supported by Jenkins for the first two years after its release, while the previous Java LTS release is the minimum version required by Jenkins.
Two years after the Java LTS release, Jenkins requires that Java LTS release as its new minimum Java version.
Four years after the Java LTS release, Jenkins stops supporting that Java LTS release because the next Java LTS release is the new minimum Java version.

Java support in Jenkins long term support releases changes on the initial (".1") release of an LTS line.
Java support in Jenkins weekly releases changes on or before the weekly release that is the baseline for the ".1" release.
Java support in Jenkins does not change in subsequent minor releases of the same Jenkins LTS baseline.

For example, Jenkins LTS 2.361.1 upgraded the minimum Java version from Java 8 to Java 11.
Jenkins weekly 2.357 upgraded the minimum Java version from Java 8 to Java 11.

=== Transition period

There is a transition period from our current Java support plan to the 2+2+2 Java support plan.
The details of the transition period are described below.
The transition period has three phases:

* <<Phase 1: Java 11>>
* <<Phase 2: Java 17>>
* <<Phase 3: Java 21>>

=== Phase 1: Java 11

Jenkins support for Java 11 continues until the last minor release of the Jenkins LTS ("2.xxx.3") prior to the **31 Oct 2024** end of Java 11 support.
The Jenkins LTS baseline ("2.xxx.1") that precedes the 31 Oct 2024 end of Java 11 support requires Java 17 as its minimum Java version.
A weekly release prior to that Jenkins LTS baseline requires Java 17 as its minimum Java version.

Jenkins uses Java 11 as its minimum Java version for a little over **two years**.
That is much less than the five years that Java 8 was the minimum Java version for Jenkins, but is well aligned with the two years from the 2+2+2 Java Support Plan.

| Date            | Release         | Minimum Java Version

| Aug  7, 2024    | 2.462.1 (LTS)   | Java 11
| Sep  4, 2024    | 2.462.2 (LTS)   | Java 11
| Sep 17, 2024    | 2.474 (weekly)  | **Java 17**
| Oct  2, 2024    | 2.462.3 (LTS)   | Java 11
| Oct 30, 2024    | 2.474.1 (LTS)   | **Java 17**
| Nov 27, 2024    | 2.474.2 (LTS)   | **Java 17**
|====

The calendar is provided as an estimate.  Release dates and version numbers are subject to change.

=== Phase 2: Java 17

Jenkins support for Java 17 continues until the last minor release of the Jenkins LTS ("2.xxx.3") prior to **31 Mar 2026**.
The 31 Mar 2026 date is approximately 18 months prior to the end of Java 17 support by Eclipse Temurin and OpenJDK.
The Jenkins LTS baseline ("2.xxx.1") that precedes the 31 Mar 2026 end of Jenkins support of Java 17 requires Java 21 as its minimum Java version.
A weekly release prior to that Jenkins LTS baseline requires Java 21 as its minimum Java version.

Jenkins uses Java 17 as its minimum Java version for approximately **18 months**.
That reduced time is needed as part of the transition to the 2+2+2 Java support plan.

.Estimated Java 17 support calendar
[%header,cols="1,1,1"]
|====
| Date            | Release         | Minimum Java Version

| Jan 21, 2026    | 2.534.1 (LTS)   | Java 17
| Feb 18, 2026    | 2.534.2 (LTS)   | Java 17
| Mar  3, 2026    | 2.546 (weekly)  | **Java 21**
| Mar 18, 2026    | 2.534.3 (LTS)   | Java 17
| Apr 15, 2026    | 2.546.1 (LTS)   | **Java 21**
| May 13, 2026    | 2.546.2 (LTS)   | **Java 21**
|====

The calendar is provided as an estimate.  Release dates and version numbers are subject to change.

=== Phase 3: Java 21

Jenkins support for Java 21 continues until the last minor release of the Jenkins LTS ("2.xxx.3") prior to **31 Oct 2027**.
The 31 Oct 2027 date is two years prior to the end of Java 21 support by Eclipse Temurin and OpenJDK.
The Jenkins LTS baseline ("2.xxx.1") that precedes the 31 Oct 2027 end of Jenkins support of Java 21 requires Java 25 as its minimum Java version.
A weekly release prior to that Jenkins LTS baseline requires Java 21 as its minimum Java version.

Jenkins uses Java 21 as its minimum Java version for approximately **18 months**.
That reduced time is needed as part of the transition to the 2+2+2 Java support plan.

.Estimated Java 21 support calendar
[%header,cols="1,1,1"]
|====
| Date            | Release         | Minimum Java Version

| Jun 23, 2027    | 2.606.1 (LTS)   | Java 21
| Jul 21, 2027    | 2.606.2 (LTS)   | Java 21
| Aug  3, 2027    | 2.618 (weekly)  | **Java 25**
| Aug 18, 2027    | 2.606.3 (LTS)   | Java 21
| Sep 15, 2027    | 2.618.1 (LTS)   | **Java 25**
| Oct 13, 2027    | 2.618.2 (LTS)   | **Java 25**
|====

The calendar is provided as an estimate.  Release dates and version numbers are subject to change.

=== Phase 4: Java 25

Jenkins support for Java 25 continues until the last minor release of the Jenkins LTS ("2.xxx.3") prior to **30 Sep 2029**.
The 30 Sep 2029 date is two years prior to the end of Java 25 support by Eclipse Temurin and OpenJDK.
The Jenkins LTS baseline ("2.xxx.1") that precedes the 30 Sep 2029 end of Jenkins support of Java 25 requires Java 29 as its minimum Java version.
A weekly release prior to that Jenkins LTS baseline requires Java 25 as its minimum Java version.

Jenkins uses Java 25 as its minimum Java version for approximately **two years**.

=== User experience

A warning administrative monitor is displayed to the user 18 months prior to the end of support of the current Java version they are running.
A "danger" administrative monitor is displayed to the user 9 months prior to the end of support of the current Java version they are running.

Container images that do not include a Java version in the container label are upgraded approximately 18 months prior to the end of support of the current Java version they are running

One or more blog posts are provided to announce the end of support for a Java version and the support of a new Java version

Changelogs, upgrade guides, and other user documentation are provided to describe the upgrade to the next Java version.

== Motivation

The 2+2+2 Java support plan balances the needs of large scale Jenkins users for predictability and stability, the needs of Jenkins developers to improve and simplify Jenkins with the latest Java capabilities, and the needs of Jenkins developers to reduce maintenance overhead associated with older Java releases.

== Reasoning

The transition period is defined to allow enough time for enterprise users of Jenkins and commercial users of products based on Jenkins to transition to Java 17.

The immediate support of new Java releases motivates Jenkins developers to remain current with Java releases.

== Backwards Compatibility

There are no backwards compatibility concerns related to this proposal.

== Security

There are no security risks related to this proposal.

== Infrastructure Requirements

Jenkins infrastructure provides early access Java versions 2 months before the release of a Java version.
Jenkins infrastructure provides Java versions from the beginning of support until 1 month after the end of Jenkins support of a Java version.

== Testing

Testing of new Java releases is performed with automated tests of Jenkins core, libraries, and plugins.
Tests are run with the Jenkins acceptance test harness and the Jenkins plugin bill of materials.

== Prototype Implementation

No prototype implemented, though Java 11, Java 17, and Java 21 support are each examples of the type of changes needed to support a new Java release.
