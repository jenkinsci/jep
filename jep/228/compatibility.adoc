= JEP-228: Unforking XStream - Compatibility

Use this space to track the status of plugins that may or may not be compatible with JEP-228.
Refer to general information about link:README.adoc#backwards-compatibility[backwards compatibility]
for tips on searching for potentially problematic API usages.

Plugins which do not do anything special with XStream need not be listed.

Please use pull requests as needed to help maintain the following table.
Plugins should be sorted by code identifier
(usually, but not always, the portion in the GitHub repository name preceding `-plugin`).

If you file issues in Jira, please apply the `JEP-228` label as well as noting them here.
