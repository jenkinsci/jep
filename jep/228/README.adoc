== Abstract

Jenkins uses the XStream serialization library to load and save most of its configuration to XML files in `$JENKINS_HOME`.
Since its origins in Hudson, this was using a fork of the upstream library maintained by the Jenkins project.
That fork is now deprecated, and Jenkins core integrates the latest official release instead.

== Specification

`org.jvnet.hudson:xstream:1.4.7-jenkins-1` is now replaced by the latest version of `com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream`, as of this writing `1.4.13`.

Automatic dynamic detection of XStream annotations was problematic and has been removed.

If link:../7/README.adoc[JEP-7] is implemented, then `XStream2.setMapper` and `.getMapperInjectionPoint` can be removed as `ruby-runtime` was the only caller.

== Motivation

Maintaining a custom fork of a library was an additional maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.
The fork was well out of date, leading to suspicions that security hardenings added in recent years may be missing, though no vulnerabilities are known.
Jenkins was also missing out on potentially useful improvements, such as
link:https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/101[better Java 11 compatibility].

A key reason for maintaining the fork was to introduce thread safety as well as concurrency-optimized collections into XStream.
In fact upstream XStream is designed to be thread-safe _after_ its configuration has been frozen.
However, Jenkins was relying on autodetection of XStream annotations during serialization (and, with some limitations, deserialization).
This forced the fork to be patched to prevent race conditions during serialization when annotations were newly discovered.
The XStream maintainer never agreed with this design and refused to integrate these patches.
This complicated maintenance of the fork, and may have led to race conditions and/or blocked threads at runtime.

== Reasoning

The original plan for dealing with thread safety was to keep a pool of `XStream2` instances backed by each public field of this type.
The pooled instances, each limited to one thread at a time, would clone configuration from the main instance.
This however seemed rather complex (there is no simple interface to implement as a proxy—`XStream` is a class with plenty of state),
and performance may have suffered from keeping these pools and duplicating various caches.
Since the number of plugins actually using XStream annotations was fairly small,
and adapting to the change can be done in as little as one line of code,
it seems simpler and better to use XStream the way its maintainer intended.

`ToolInstaller.properties` was tough to deal with.
This field must be serialized via XStream (for example it lists `ToolInstallation` instances),
but cannot be serialized over Remoting
(neither its collection type, nor typical element types, are or could reasonably be made `Serializable`).
Nor did it seems reasonable to mark the field `transient` but define a custom XStream converter, since subclasses have their own fields.
Fortunately not a lot of plugins seem to attempt to send a `ToolInstaller` over Remoting;
all the known cases involve some agent-side computation that actually only needs the tool home directory.
Also it turned out to be possible to detect Remoting-based serialization and delegate the cloning to XStream
after patching out the `<properties>…</properties>` section.

== Backwards Compatibility

See the link:compatibility.adoc[compatibility table].

=== Autodetection of annotations

Jenkins no longer configures XStream to autodetect annotations on the fly.
Therefore plugins which use XStream-defined annotations (rather than Java method calls)
need to call `processAnnotations` as an initialization step,
either in a `static` block or an `@Initializer`.

[source,bash]
----
find *-plugin/{,*/}src/main/java -type f -print0 | xargs -0 fgrep com.thoughtworks.xstream.annotations
----

can be used to find plugins making use of XStream annotations.
Some of these already call `processAnnotations` to explicitly register the classes.
To be compatible, all of them should be made to either use `processAnnotations`,
or directly call non-annotation-based APIs such as `alias`.

Interestingly, calling `processAnnotations`
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/xstream-fork/blob/af17a1b2d8fc7c9dcfee635252a8a3c32f956d26/xstream/src/java/com/thoughtworks/xstream/mapper/AnnotationMapper.java#L158-L166[disables subsequent autodetection]
of annotations for that `XStream` instance.
This implies many plugins relying on autodetection of annotations were already broken under some conditions,
depending on which other plugins were installed and the precise order of operations.

=== Serializability of `ToolInstallation`

Previously, `ToolInstallation` implemented `Serializable` and was eligible for transfer over a Remoting channel to an agent.
The `properties` field, however, was ignored in this mode, while saved by XStream.
That trick relied on a custom patch to XStream which has no upstream equivalent.
Therefore, `ToolInstallation` is no longer `Serializable` as far as Java (or Pipeline) serialization is concerned.

[source,bash]
----
find *-plugin/{,*/}src/main/java -type f -print0 | xargs -0 egrep -l 'class \S+ extends ToolInstallation' | xargs fgrep -l MasterToSlave
----

can be used to find plugins which might be serializing `ToolInstallation` over Remoting.
These should stop doing so (usually refactoring the remote callable to be `static` and carry just a `String home` field),
but will remain compatible for now with a runtime warning.

=== Inherited private serialization methods

Older versions of XStream honored `readResolve` or `writeReplace` methods in subclasses even when declared as `private` in the superclass.
This violated the expectations of Java serialization, and so this behavior has now been fixed:
only accessible (e.g., `protected`) methods of these names will be considered in the inheritance chain.

The `TestBuilder` test utility in `jenkins-test-harness`, among other classes,
relied on this trick to avoid saving itself to `config.xml`
(which would frequently fail due to captured outer class references).
Numerous plugins use `TestBuilder` (or, more rarely, `TestNotifier`) in functional tests.
These tests should still run, even if the build step is an inner class,
but will produce a runtime warning; it is better to update the parent POM to 4.8 or newer to pick up a fix.

=== `XStreamSerializable`

The custom annotation `XStreamSerializable` is no longer available.
There is no equivalent.
It was used only in `ToolInstaller`.

=== `XStreamSerializeAs`

The custom annotation `XStreamSerializeAs` is no longer available.
`XStreamAliasType` can be used instead.
It was used only in the `persona` plugin,
which has since been link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-10-08/#SECURITY-2046[removed from the update center].

=== `HierarchicalStreamReader.peekNextChild`

This method no longer exists.
It has long been defined in a subtype `ExtendedHierarchicalStreamReader`;
only the fork redundantly defined it also in the supertype.

== Security

There are no known security risks related to this proposal.
Defenses introduced in JEP-200 are left intact,
even though newer versions of XStream include their own simpler serialization security system.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

Besides tests inside Jenkins core itself,
CloudBees will endeavor to verify that all
link:https://docs.cloudbees.com/search?&type=ci-plugins&ci-plugins-tier=verified[“Tier 1”] and
link:https://docs.cloudbees.com/search?&type=ci-plugins&ci-plugins-tier=compatible[“Tier 2”]
plugins are compatible with the core changes,
as determined by acceptance tests (ATH) and `plugin-compat-tester` (PCT).

== Prototype Implementation

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4944[jenkins #4944] is the main change.
