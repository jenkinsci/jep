== Abstract

Jenkins installation setup require various configuration steps users have to handle on the web UI. This provides flexibility for newcomers,
but for repeated deployment, users are all looking for some way to automate things and provide a reproducible installation.

Configuration-as-Code is a DevOps practice to manage software configuration as versioned files managed in SCM, which can be tested,
discussed and validated in various environments before they actually update the production target.

Many Companies do rely on dozens or hundred Jenkins masters, and as such require some way to control their setup and initial configuration.


== Specification

=== Declarative configuration as code

We want to introduce a simple way to define Jenkins configuration from a declarative document that would be accessible even to newcomers.
Such a document should replicate the web UI user experience so the resulting structure looks natural to end user. Jenkins components have
to be identified by convention or user-friendly names rather than by actual implementation class name.

=== Mimic web UI

We consider web UI as a natural documentation for end-user. As they switch to configuration-as-code they will search for the labels and
model their use to see on web UI. The configuration-as-code model should follow as much as possible this model.

=== No glue-code requirement

We want configuration-as-code to apply to all jenkins components without need for dedicated glue-code. But we also want to provide some
helper code that would make some specific components easier to configure, or better reflect the web UI user experience.

=== Documentation Generation

The configuration file format has to be well documented to assist end-user in writing. This documentation has to be generated to ensure
it’s in sync with the actual codebase, like Pipeline DSL documentation does.

=== Validation

The configuration file should be validated without the need to actually run a Jenkins master. At same time we generate documentation we
need to generate some schema that could also be used with adequate IDE / editor to assist writing configuration.


== Motivation

=== Goals

There's various ways to manage Jenkins configuration without human interaction :

* Chef / Puppet / Ansible recipes. Some are https://github.com/jenkinsci/puppet-jenkins[maintained by Jenkins community]
* Groovy init scripts
* CLI from shell scripts
* XML templating
* custom plugins like https://github.com/jenkinsci/system-config-dsl-plugin[system-config-dsl-plugin]
* ...

All those require a deep knowledge of Jenkins internal model and/or xml storage format, to correctly invoke API methods from script or
produce adequate xml structure, while end user only knows Jenkins Web UI. Those approaches make configuration-automation a reserved
practice for advanced Jenkins users.

Configuration as Code should not be available only to advanced Jenkins users. Typically, when selecting implementation for an extension
point, a non-expert end-user doesn't know the actual class name to be used internally and stored in xml configuration; they just select a
label in a dropdown list. This is what we want to offer “as-code”.

=== Target Audience

We have identified two personas as target Audience :

*Ben* is system administrator in the company, managing services across all teams: LDAP, Mail, but also developers ressources like
repositories and CI servers. Ben’s favorite IDE is vi, his preferred language is bash (or maybe ruby|python) and only knows Java for the
amount of memory it requires and the delay to start a JVM. So he’s not a big fan of writing groovy scripts. He mostly knows Jenkins by the
UI and used to backup for whole JENKINS_HOME folder.

*Seb* is working in a startup as DevOps engineer. He’s full time working with product team as a developer and managing development process
and resources (which makes 2 full times for one guy. This is a startup I said). Seb has deployed kubernetes as general purpose
infrastructure on the Cloud and deployed a git repo and few other services for his team. A Jenkins master is running there as well. He's used
to upgrade jenkins by running latest official docker image and re-using previous jenkins-home volume.

== Reasoning

Configuration as Code as a simple text file with both documentation and schema that would make it possible for any Jenkins user to replicate
the configuration they would previously setup by hand on web UI.

This is a major differentiator vs Groovy init scripts used by many Advanced Jenkins users, who are confident with internal APIs and Groovy
syntax. Using a basic text file format with validation makes this feature available to arbitrary DevOps teams without the need to be familiar
with Jenkins or Groovy.

=== File format

To avoid Configuration as Code being tied to a specific developer community, we selected YAML as format to define Jenkins configuration.

YAML allows us to :

* Have a plain text, human readable format
* Include comments to provide runnable sample configuration files
* Be language ecosystem agnostic
* Support JSON-schema validation

=== Configuration mechanism

==== Yaml syntax

Yaml do support complex data structures, like Maps, nested yaml, merges ... but initial alpha release demonstrate this isn't well
understood by end users which mostly expect a simple tree syntax, comparable to `json`.

For this reason Configuration-as-Code do only support a subset of Yaml syntax:

* http://yaml.org/type/map.html[Mapping] with String keys
* http://yaml.org/type/seq.html[Sequences]
* basic Scalar types

This restriction allows to keep the yaml file simple and readable even by newcomers. Jenkins plugins which internal design would
require more complex models will have to provide a dedicated "simplified" model object with custom adapter code. Option for a plugin
to provide a customized adapter is part of Configuration-as-Code design to support such corner-cases.

==== Component names

Configuration files define a tree model.
For every node, we need to find the matching Jenkins component. Relying on `@Symbol` annotation is an
efficient way to identify components with a human friendly short name. For plugin which haven't (yet) adopted this annotation, we can rely
on some convention. A common pattern is to name an implementation class as prefix + API class name, like `LDAPSecurityRealm`. As we know
the API we are looking for implementation, we can establish a natural short name for this implementation as “ldap” and offer a Symbol-like
short name to the end user for his configuration file.

==== General mechanism

++DataBoundSetter++s & ++DataBoundConstructor++s offer a natural way to construct Jenkins components from a set of key=value pairs. Most
jenkins components do rely on them and as such offer a 1:1 match between internal data structure and web UI configuration forms. Component to follow UI binding conventions and best practices will then be supported out-of-the-box. The few of them with custom UI binding rules should be easily fixed, as the required changes are limited to data binding conventions.

==== Descriptors global configuration

A major exception to this is ++Descriptor++s which in many cases rely on manual parsing of +JSONObject+. In this JEP we propose to offer guidance and recommendation for plugin developers to apply the same databinding mechanisme to descriptor's ++configure++ method. We published a https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/PLUGINS.md[step-by-step guide] for this purpose and will open pull-requests on few commons plugins to demonstrate this approach.

Most plugin do already have setters for descriptor's attribte, designed to enable configuration from groovy scripts. We do rely on those when they exist, but adoption databinding mechanisms will ensure

1. accessors name and types do match the internal data model
1. all attributes are configurable relying on DataBound setters.

==== Attribute naming

===== Aliases
In few cases attribute and accessors names do no match the UI labels, either for legacy reasons ("slave" vs "agent") or for technical databinding implementation details ("lavelString" vs "label"). As we want the configuration-as-code model to mimic web UI, considering this one is "natural documentation" for most users, we need to fix this.
We propose to document in setters the attribute preferred name using an ++@Symbol++ annotation (see https://github.com/jenkinsci/structs-plugin/pull/18[structs-plugin#18]).

We consider this to be a **must have** feature

===== Delegate
There's other places where attribute are managed within web UI by a dedicated compoment. ++Jenkins.securityRealm++ for sample is managed by ++GlobalSecurityConfiguration++ component, which doesn't have any attribute by himself.

We propose to declare such management delegation as annotations on the attribute owner. So Jenkins.securityRealm would document attribute is actually managed by ++GlobalSecurityConfiguration++, and the later would offer setters for securityRealm, to actually configure Jenkins owning component.

We consider this to be a **nive to have** feature

==== Corner cases

In some circumstances the Java codebase doesn’t match the web UI forms and relies on some custom code for configuration. The Jenkins root
object is such a component. For those, we need to provide some dedicated configuration adapter code. Some plugins might need the same.
We have identified credentials-plugin as such a component.

=== Documentation / Schema generation

As configuration-as-code mechanism relies on data-binding mechanism, we can construct a full data model from a live jenkins instance, and
produce documentation. We also can include help tips from various inputs as additional guidance to end-user reading the doc.

The same way we generate documentation we can generate a JSON-schema to validate a configuration file without need to run a jenkins master
for acceptance.

=== (Im)mutability
Depending on the audience, some want to use configuration-as-code to generate a working Jenkins master with some initial configuration, but
also let the actual administrator make changes. Such use case is mostly looking for “recipe for a new jenkins master”.

Others want configuration-as-code to fully control the master, and be able to apply updates. Comparable to Chef/Puppet/Ansible management.

Both use cases can be supported (as well as a mix of both).

The former just uses the configuration-as-code mechanism for initial setup.

The latter would apply the configuration when updates are detected on file. It could benefit some way to lock down configuration for
components configured by the configuration-as-code mechanism to be read-only on web UI.


== Backwards Compatibility

Configuration-as-Code is intended to run as an additional Jenkins component (most probably: a plugin) and not require dedicated extension
integrated in Jenkins-core nor specific API implemented by plugins. We only require them to follow some convention in the way they expose
configuration attributes (i.e +DataBoundSetter|Constructor+)

== Versioning

Configuration-as-Code doesn't define a model for the configuration expressed in Yaml file. The yaml schema will depend on a specific
versions of jenkins-core and plugins being used at runtime. Any change to a plugin will change this model, this will happen any time a
`DataBoundConstructor` is modified, setter added or renamed, etc. This is the price to pay for alignment with UI databinding and support
for any plugin out of the box ("no glue code").

For the same reason, Configuration-as-Code way to infer the configuration model from a live instance will depend on Configuration-as-Code
plugin version being used, and the resulting model could change when updating plugin version.
Genrally speaking, there's no such thing like a `version` we could define
to offer backward compatibility and load a yaml file defined for a previous version of Configuration-as-Code or for a distinct combination
of jenkins-core + plugins.

So compatibility on version upgrade cannot be expected. But with JCasC we can produce a schema and tooling to discover such compatibility
issue and let end-user know before they apply to production. Also, binary compatibility requirement in Jenkins ecosystem will significantly
limit the risk for a broken configuration.


== Security

Sensible informations should _not_ be exposed directly within the yaml configuration file.
Configuration-as-Code do support string expansion using a bash-like `${KEY}` syntax for string based values. Configuration-as-Code do also define
an API to connect with third-party secret-sources. Out of the box we do support environment variable expansion, which should only be considered
for testing purpose, as well as file-based secret source (docker-secret, kubernetes-secret) and a Vault connector. Third party plugins can be developped to offer comparable support with other secret providers.

== Infrastructure Requirements

N/A

== Testing

We will provide a set of configuration samples for various popular plugins, both as documentation for newcomers and for acceptance testing of the
implementation.
