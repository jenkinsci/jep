== Abstract

Multiple security issues have been found in Jenkins due to a previous oversight in the dispatchability rules for invoking views in the Stapler web framework.
This JEP describes the new APIs and rules for controlling whether or not a view should be dispatched.
The Stapler feature was developed as SECURITY-534 in private and published as part of the updates for the https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-07-17/#SECURITY-534[2019-07-17 Jenkins Security Advisory].

== Specification

In Stapler, requests are matched against a list of possible `Dispatcher` instances that return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not that `Dispatcher` could successfully handle the request.
The view dispatchers used in Jenkins consist of ones backed by script engines (also called _facets_) to allow for different programming languages to be used to write response content such as Jelly and Groovy.

This JEP specifies the interface `DispatchValidator` to allow for finer-grained control over how views are dispatched along with the interface `ScriptExecutor` for rendering views in response.
Facets using validating dispatchers will first verify that a view is not explicitly denied by the validator.
After loading the view, the executor has the responsibility of performing a final check for an explicitly allowed dispatch before any response output is written.
If at either of these points the dispatch is cancelled, then the dispatcher returns `false` which allows lower priority dispatchers to attempt dispatching the request.

The default Jenkins implementation of `DispatchValidator` allows for views to be identified as dispatchable or fragments.

* Views can use one of `l:view`, `l:layout`, or `l:ajax` from the `/lib/layout` Jelly tag library as described in <<views>>.
* Views named `index` are automatically considered to be dispatchable.
* Views that set an HTTP `Content-Type` header before writing any output are considered dispatchable.
* Models can be annotated with `@StaplerViews` and `@StaplerFragments` as described in <<model-class-annotations>>.
* A whitelist file can be provided listing model class names and their corresponding dispatchable views and fragment views as described in <<whitelist-file>>.

=== Definitions

Facet::
Strategy for dispatching views written in different programming languages or other resource types.
Most facets are script engines that dynamically render a response from a model and view.
Dispatch::
Execution phase of HTTP request handling where responses are formed and responded.
Model::
Object node used inside views to render response data.
Oftentimes referred to as `it` in Jenkins views.
View::
Scripts supplied with a model as input and render HTTP response data as output.
Views have corresponding HTTP MIME types, typically `text/html`.
Dispatchable view::
View that is meant to be dispatched directly from Stapler.
Oftentimes referred to as just a _view_ for short.
Fragment view::
View that is meant to be included from dispatchable views and never dispatched directly.
Referred to as a _fragment_ for short.

=== Views

Jenkins views must use one of `l:layout`, `l:ajax`, or `l:view` Jelly tags defined in `/lib/layout`.
To be more specific, a view must set an HTTP `Content-Type` header before any output is rendered.
Most UI elements are already written using one of the first two tags, while some more specialized views are written with `l:view`.
For example, using Jelly:

[source,xml]
----
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:l="/lib/layout">
  <l:view contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8">
    <html>
      <!-- fancy SPA -->
    </html>
  </l:view>
</j:jelly>
----

Or using Groovy:

[source,groovy]
----
def l = namespace('/lib/layout')
l.view(contentType: 'text/html;charset=UTF-8') {
  html {
    // ...
  }
}
----

=== Model Class Annotations

A model class can be annotated with `@StaplerViews` to list out which views are dispatchable.
Likewise, using `@StaplerFragments`, the list of views considered fragments are declared.
Any views not listed in those annotations on the model class or any of its parents remain unaffected by this filtering.
Use of these annotations takes precedence over the presence of the layout tags listed in the above subsection.

This provides methods to specify and override default views and fragments.
For example, suppose Jenkins defines an abstract class `BaseClass` which has views `index`, `configure`, `create`, and `delete`.
Implementation classes are expected to provide their own fragment view `config` which gets included in `configure` and `create`.
This can be encoded explicitly in the model class:

[source,java]
----
@StaplerViews({"configure", "create", "delete"}) // index is implicit
@StaplerFragments("config")
public abstract class BaseClass {
    ...
}
----

By adding the annotations to Jenkins, implementation classes (typically from plugins) can be filtered explicitly via the parent annotations without updating the downstream code.
Implementation classes may further define additional views or fragments.
For example, suppose `ExtendedClass` extends `BaseClass` and adds its own optional fragment view `advanced` which its implementation classes can include.

[source,java]
----
@StaplerFragments("advanced")
public class ExtendedClass extends BaseClass {
    ...
}
----

=== Whitelist File

Jenkins ships with a default whitelist of common, known views in plugins that would otherwise be broken by the above rules.
This file consists of class names and their respective views and fragments.
These entries have the same effect as annotating the listed classes with the above annotations.
The syntax for this file is defined below.

[source,bnf]
----
<line> ::= <fully-qualified-model-class-name> <ws> <view-list>
<view-list> ::= <view-entry> | <view-entry> <ws> <view-list>
<view-entry> ::= <view-name> | "!" <view-name>
<ws> ::= " " | " " <ws>
----

For each view entry, if the view name is prefixed by a `!`, then it is added as a fragment view.
Otherwise, the view name is added as a dispatchable view.

Additional whitelist entries can be specified by the file `$JENKINS_HOME/stapler-views-whitelist.txt` or whatever path is specified by the system property `jenkins.security.stapler.StaplerDispatchValidator.whitelist`.

== Motivation

During exploratory testing, the Jenkins security team discovered a specific type of vulnerability spread throughout the ecosystem of Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
This vulnerability allows for many fragment views to be directly dispatched by Stapler using specifically crafted URLs.
Stapler does not make a distinction between views that are meant to be dispatchable and those that are meant to only be included as fragment views.
Fragment views rarely enforce permission checks of their own as they expect an implicit containing view to handle that.
Some of these fragment views can leak information when dispatched directly, though many fragments will throw an exception early on due to referencing uninitialized variables or functions.

Reviewing a large codebase of Jenkins plugins, several different patterns emerged that provide hints as to whether or not a view was likely meant to be dispatchable or not.
The most useful of these is the fact that all dispatchable views declare a `Content-Type` HTTP header either explicitly or implicitly through the `l:layout` and `l:ajax` Jelly tags from `/lib/layout`.
Fragment views, on the other hand, do not normally use either of those tags, nor do they ever write out a `Content-Type` HTTP header.

== Reasoning

The Jenkins security team cannot simply patch every single fragment view to apply permission checks or other necessary guards.
Other similar ideas that require changing affected plugins are out of scope due to the immense scale of such an endeavour.
Instead, an automated solution is devised to detect if a view being dispatched from Stapler should be rejected or not.
Using the heuristic obtained for well-behaved views described in <<motivation>>, an extensible dispatch filtering system is needed to fix these vulnerabilities all at once.
After some iterations explained below, a Stapler SPI is proposed that fulfills these goals.

=== Stapler SPI

Stapler defines a `DispatchValidator` SPI to offload most of the dispatchability logic to that implementation.
Similar to JEP-218, this is done to make changes to Stapler fairly contained which allows for more rapid iterations of development.
This also allows for Stapler to remain backward compatible in its behavior while allowing Jenkins to move forward with a safer web framework.
Stapler also defines a `ScriptExecutor` interface to reduce duplication of dispatch validation logic between different facets.

=== Separate Annotation Library

To allow plugin developers to make use of the new and updated annotations, the previously created `jenkins-stapler-support` annotation library is updated with `@StaplerViews` and `@StaplerFragments` in version 1.1.
This allows plugins to use the annotations without requiring a recent release of Jenkins as a dependency.

=== Lack of JSP and JRuby Support

Stapler supports views written in other languages besides Jelly and Groovy.
However, the vast majority of views in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins are written in those two languages.
The existing facets and dispatchers for JSP and ERB (JRuby) views do not support view dispatch filtering and will instead continue to be dispatched as before.

=== Rejection of Fragment Filename Syntax Approach

One proposed way to indicate that a view is a fragment was to prefix fragment view filenames with an underscore.
For example, a view named `configure.jelly` may include a descriptor list of `_config.jelly` fragments.
Transparent rewrites of includes to fragment views would preserve compatibility between plugins.
This idea was rejected eventually due to combinatorical compatibility complexities.

=== Rejection of META-INF Service Approach

One approach considered to the SPI was using service discovery via `META-INF/services/` implementations.
This approach adds too much complexity in maintaining compatibility with both a default behavior for Stapler as well as an overriding behavior in Jenkins.
Composite filters are outside the scope of this SPI.

=== Rejection of 404 Not Found Approach

During development, view dispatch was cancelled by responding with a 404 Not Found error.
This approach would prevent further dispatchers such as `doDynamic` from operating along with any other dispatcher with lower precedence than view dispatch.

=== Rejection of Standard Request Attribute Approach

A fairly similar implementation to the one described in this JEP was previously developed with more of the validation business logic exposed in Stapler.
This defined a specific servlet request attribute that would be used for storing the current request's dispatch filter status along with an API for manipulating that attribute.
This approach was rejected due to exposing too many unnecessary implementation details inside Stapler that preferrably belong inside Jenkins.

== Backwards Compatibility

This JEP comes with a significant risk of backward incompatibility due to using a heuristic approach by default to determine whether or not a view should be dispatchable.
Combined with the typically low integration test coverage for plugins, it's possible that some views may be blocked that would otherwise not be.
To mitigate this, several strategies are implemented:

* Views can use the `l:view` tag to declare themselves as views if not using `l:layout` or `l:ajax` already to conveniently set a `Content-Type` HTTP header.
* Views that are named `index` or set an HTTP `Content-Type` response header before writing output are automatically considered dispatchable.
* Model classes can be updated with `@StaplerViews` and `@StaplerFragments` to explicitly list out which views should be dispatchable or not.
* A default whitelist file is included for popular plugins derived from automated testing.
* Additional dispatchable views and fragments views can be declared in a configurable whitelist file.

== Security

This JEP fixes a potentially unbounded number of security vulnerabilities involving unexpected fragment view access by dispatching views that aren't meant to be dispatched directly.
However, this does not fix any similar problems in JSP, JRuby, or other more exotic view types that aren't typically used in plugins.

== Infrastructure Requirements

A new redirect `https://jenkins.io/redirect/stapler-facet-restrictions` has been created to be a permalink used in log messages related to dispatch filtering.
This provides information for administrators and plugin developers about how to handle whitelist violations.

== Testing

Automated test cases are provided to test for the new dispatchability override features.
Existing test cases, particularly ones involving JTH or ATH, help exercise the UI which can help find any incorrectly filtered views.
Due to the lack of explicit test coverage in verifying UI pages rendering, this change must be manually verified with various plugins to ensure nothing has broken.
Explicit log messages similar to JEP-218 are provided so that users who discover a broken view can see why and report an issue upstream.
Exploration of existing plugins has helped identify common problematic patterns used in views that would have otherwise been broken by this validation.
Any plugins affected by this fix after publication are being tracked https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+the+SECURITY-534+fix[in this wiki page].

== Implementation

This was initially implemented in Jenkins 2.176.2 (LTS) and 2.186 (weekly) as part of a security update.
