== Abstract

The first pillar of _Jenkins Essentials_ is that it is an link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300#auto-update[Automatically Updated Distribution].

To be able to achieve this goal in a durable way, we need to be able to _automatically assess the health_ of a *given* instance.
The scope of this proposal is to design the way we decide if we link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/302[automatically roll back] or not.

It will also regularly be fed back to the backend so that we can compute global health statistics for a given setup, but that is out of scope for the current document.

== Specification

We do expect to evolve the health-checking process as we learn, but as the local healthcheck is a critical part of the overall _Essentials_ story, we want to start _small_ on purpose.
Once we deem to have learned enough, we will create new proposals to discuss and document the new checks we want to add.

We will check two URLs:

* the `/instance-identity/` page
* the `/metrics/evergreen/healthcheck`

=== Instance Identity URL

We check that:

* it is reachable,
* and returns a 200 HTTP status code.

=== `/metrics/evergreen/healthcheck` URL

We configure the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/metrics-plugin/[Metrics Jenkins plugin] to provide a healthcheck under the specified URL.
The prettified returned format is the following

[source,json,title=`/metrics/evergreen/healthcheck` URL output]
{
  "disk-space": {
    "healthy": true
  },
  "plugins": {
    "healthy": true,
    "message": "No failed plugins"
  },
  "temporary-space": {
    "healthy": true
  },
  "thread-deadlock": {
    "healthy": true
  }
}

From this URL, we check that:

* it returns a 200 HTTP status code
* On the produced JSON
** it is valid JSON
** `plugins.healthy` attribute is `true`
** `thread-deadlock.healthy` attribute is `true`

We are *not* checking the space related attributes on purpose, at least for now.
The rationale being that the upgrade to a new _Essentials_ BOM
footnote:[Bill Of Materials: the configuration file describing what an Essentials release is made of: what exact WAR version, which plugins, etc.]
 could consume a bit more disk space, and trigger a disk space warning.
We probably do not want to wholly revert an upgrade because of this.

==== Absence of the `metrics` plugin

Making this plugin a part of the healthchecking story obviously makes it a *required* plugin.
So the _evergreen-client_ should make sure it is always present and active when upgrading.
For instance, if it is disabled, or removed from the disk, it *must* be forcefully reinstalled and enabled automatically next time.

If for some reason, the plugin fails to start, then the healthcheck should fall back to only check the `/instance-identity/`, and report this issue as critical to the backend.

==== Metrics plugin Configuration

The plugin is configured using the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin[Configuration As Code] Jenkins plugin, using the following syntax:

[source,yaml,title=Essentials Configuration-as-code file]
---
jenkins:
  # [snip other configurations]
  metricsaccesskey:
    accessKeys:
      - key:            "evergreen"
        description:    "Key for evergreen health-check"
        canHealthCheck: true
        canPing:        false
        canThreadDump:  false
        canMetrics:     false
        origins:        "*"

== Motivation

There is nothing existing in this area.

== Reasoning

=== Why not leverage the error logging

In the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/304[JEP-304 on _Essentials Client Error Telemetry Logging_], we describe how the Jenkins instance is _publishing_ its error logging.

We are not going to use those logs for now for the reason stated previously: we do no think we know enough how to use them correctly yet.
So we are taking a careful path here: anyway, those logs are going to be sent to the backend as a one of the data points for assessing quality of given releases.

Over time, once we have a better idea of what they typically are, and how to use them, this is likely we will design a new proposal to enrich the way we do the healthchecking process from the _evergreen-client_.

== Backwards Compatibility

There are no backwards compatibility concerns related to this proposal.

== Security

[[metrics-endpoint-access]]
=== Accessing the `/metrics/evergreen/healthcheck` URL from outside the container

Though this is probably not a problematic data leak that it is accessible to anyone who would already be able to reach the server, we plan to use the `origins` field to restrict requesters to be `localhost` so that only the _evergreen-client_ can access it.

CAUTION: Seems like this field is actually not designed for source IP filtering.
If so, we will either add this feature to the metrics plugin or adjust the proposal to confirm the sentence above: that we don't deem it critical that this URL is accessible from outside the container for security.

=== Using `evergreen` as the metrics access key

Normally, a `metrics` plugin healthcheck URL is of the format `SERVER/metrics/<access-key>/healthcheck`.

We set the the accesskey value for clarity and simplicity: this makes it unnecessary to write some logic to initialize a random access key, and have the client store or access it from somewhere.

Once the healthcheck endpoint access will be <<metrics-endpoint-access,restricted to localhost only>>, that is deemed to not an issue anymore.

[[metrics-absence]]
=== Absence of the `metrics` plugin

An attacker could try to make the plugin fail, for instance by implementing an extension in a bad way.

If this ends up making the plugin fail to start, this should be detected by the _evergreen-client_ and it will fall back to the simpler mode when only the `/instance-identity/` URL is checked.


== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

This component and any change to it should be tested very aggressively, as it could trigger unneeded rollbacks in production or worse if broken.

There should particularly be a testcase to check the behaviour <<metrics-absence,in absence of the _Metrics_ plugin>>, or generally with failed plugins.

== Prototype Implementation

* https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen and more specifically the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen/pull/44[PR-44].

== References

* See also link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/302[JEP-302: Evergreen snapshotting data safety system] as the _evergreen-client_ will use the current proposal to trigger or not a rollback using the specification in _JEP-302_.
