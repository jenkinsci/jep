== Abstract

The technical ability to package JARs as Jenkins modules is retained
but all such existing modules currently bundled in the Jenkins WAR
are converted to regular plugins.
Some modules are coalesced into a single plugin for simplicity.

== Specification

`instance-identity` is converted from a module to a detached plugin.
It is given a dependency on the `bouncycastle-api` plugin rather than a repackaged copy of BouncyCastle.
Popular plugins currently depending on this module in `provided` scope are made to declare a regular plugin-to-plugin dependency.

`sshd` is converted from a module to a detached plugin.
It is updated to Apache SSH 2.x.
`ssh-cli-auth` is inlined into the same plugin.
Popular plugins (notable `git-server`) can again be given a regular plugin dependency on `sshd`.

Both new plugins are added to the plugin BOM and removed from the core BOM.

=== Cleanup options

As another cleanup step, `workflow-cps-global-lib` can be given a dependency on `git-server` and thus `sshd` for its original Git-based design,
but formally deprecated and the SCM-based library system almost exclusively used these days
split into a new plugin such as `pipeline-libraries` without this dependency.

The `jenkins-module` packaging could be removed from `maven-hpi-plugin`, if there are no other users.
(Theoretically some vendors could be using it for a `ConfidentialStore` implementation, for example.)

== Motivation

Having hundreds of extensions be built and packaged in one way, as plugins,
yet eight in another way, as modules,
is an added conceptual complication to the Jenkins architecture
that increases the learning curve and can introduce exceptional cases to various tools and processes.

One particular example of special behavior is that modules are treated differently at build time from either plugins or Jenkins core library dependencies.
They must be included in plugin POMs using `provided` scope.
To define the right version requires use of the `jenkins-bom`:
they are not implied as transitive dependencies of `jenkins-core`,
nor are they listed like plugin dependencies in the plugin `bom`,
and the versions must be aligned with that of Jenkins core.

Like anything else packaged in `jenkins.war`,
modules cannot be updated except part of the relatively slow Jenkins core weekly/LTS cycle.
This makes it more difficult to keep up with libraries such as Apache SSH.

FIPS compliance for `instance-identity` is made more difficult by not using the `bouncycastle-api` plugin.

== Reasoning

=== Inlining all modules into core

All of these modules could be made part of `jenkins-core.jar`.
This would however go against the principle of allowing Jenkins to be modular
and letting administrators and packaging systems (such as `jenkinsfile-runner`) decide which pieces are important.
Some of them also have dependency issues (see below about `instance-identity`).

=== Status quo

These eight packages could be left as modules.
But to reverse the question, suppose functionality of this kind,
such as adding an SSH server,
were proposed as a new feature of Jenkins.
The author would likely be urged to do so as a new plugin.
Jenkins core developers would certainly not accept a proposal to introduce a novel mechanism for bundling extensions
when plugin packaging is used for everything else and works fine.

You might assume that the existing modules were written as modules because they _had_ to be:
they might have needed to be loaded in the same `ClassLoader` as `jenkins-core.jar`,
for example to use `@MetaInfServices`.
In fact this was not the case; they all implement regular `@Extension` points.

One objection to an earlier proposal,
in which all eight modules were individually made into plugins and marked detached,
was that it would bloat the implied dependencies of existing plugins
and the list of installed plugins.
This is less of a concern when there are only two detached plugins being added.

=== Switching `groupId`

The Maven group id could be switched to, say, `io.jenkins.plugins` to more closely match the conventional style.
Instead the existing group and artifacts ids are retained (for example `org.jenkins-ci.modules:sshd`)
to simplify updates from plugin POMs and to make it clear that these _are_ updates.

=== Inlining `instance-identity` into core

Since instance identity is conceptually a basic part of Jenkins core,
and `InstanceIdentityProvider` expects to have a single implementation `InstanceIdentityRSAProvider`,
it would be nicer to simply inline this into core and deprecate the extension point.
That would also assure that `IdentityRootAction` is always present;
and would ensure that inbound TCP agents always work, without needing to extract them to a plugin depending on `instance-identity`.
(WebSocket-based inbound agents from link:../222/README.adoc[JEP-222] do not require `instance-identity`.)

Unfortunately doing so would require including BouncyCastle in core,
something we would prefer not do;
it is currently included as a library wrapper plugin.
For now it seems much more straightforward to make `instance-identity` a (detached) plugin.
If this decision needs to be reversed in the future,
`InstanceIdentityRSAProvider` or its equivalent could just be added to core
and `instance-identity` made an empty deprecated “tombstone”.

=== Keeping `ssh-cli-auth` separate

As of the removal of Remoting-based CLI,
`ssh-cli-auth` merely provided utility classes used by `sshd`,
with no independent functionality.
Therefore there is no advantage in offering it as a separate plugin.

== Backwards Compatibility

The use of the detached plugin mechanism should assure that plugins formerly depending on functionality here,
namely in `instance-identity` and `sshd`,
continue to run.
Users upgrading Jenkins past the change will see these now-detached plugins installed automatically.

Non-GUI installations of Jenkins may need to add `instance-identity` to the plugin set in order for TCP inbound agents to work.
Similarly, they would need to add `sshd` to the plugin set in order to enable SSH service for the Jenkins CLI.

== Security

There are no security risks related to this proposal.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

Various scenarios involving affected code need to be tested either manually or in acceptance tests.
`RealJenkinsRule`-based tests may need to be introduced since the changes involve class loading.
