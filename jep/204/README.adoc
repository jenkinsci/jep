== Abstract

The BlueOcean extensiblity api is the way in which Jenkins plugin developers extend the BlueOcean UI.
This JEP describes how extensions are defined and implemented.

== Specification

=== Extension Store
This is the only global object exposed by the extension system; it stores Extension Points and Extensions implementing it.
This is where an extension registry is stored and during javascript execution offers lookup capability to apply the Extension Points or call the rendering function.

==== Registering Extensions

Extensions in Jenkins are normally discovered with the `@Extension` annotation.
Javascript has no runtime methods to discover extensions automatically, so an explicit call to `register()` is needed.

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @param {string} extensionPointId - Unique string that idenifies the extension point.
 * @param {function} callbackFn - Extension function<1>
 */
window.extensionStore.register(extensionPointId, callbackFn)
----
<1> <<extensionfunction>>

===== Registration Event Listener

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @param {string} event - The event to register a callback against.
 * @param {function} callbackFn - Callback function to be executed on event
 */
window.extensionStore.registerListener(event, callbackFn)
----

==== List of Extension Points

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @returns {string[]} List of extension point ids that are registered.
 */
window.extensionStore.getExtensionPointIds()
----

==== Listing of Extensions for a Extension Point

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @param {string} [extensionPointId] - Extension point to get registered extensions for. If not provided return all extensions.
 */
window.extensionStore.getExtensions(extensionPointId)
----

[#extensionfunction]
=== Extension function

Extensions are implemented as functions, specific extension points will define what contract the extensions must implement. The basic format is:

[source,javascript]
----
function(context) {
    // Extension code
}
----

The extension point defines what context it will give extensions.
This could be contextual data or it could be callback functions to provide data to the extension point

==== Extensions that render

Extensions that want to render UI are a specialized version of the general extension function.
Extension points will pass in a `container` div for the extension to render into.

[source,javascript]
----
function(context) {
    context.container.innerHTML = "<p>No test results</p>"
}
----

== Motivation

BlueOcean has an extensibility system built around https://github.com/jenkinsci/js-builder[js-builder] and https://github.com/jenkinsci/js-modules[js-modules].
It currently forces plugins to implement extensions as React components.

There are some key issues with the way that it is currently implemented.

=== Extensions as React components

Because extensions are react components, it uses `ReactDOM` provided by BlueOcean to render them.
This forces extensions to use the same version of React as BlueOcean.
The main issue with this if BlueOcean needs to upgrade React, every plugin will need to be updated too, or potentially have runtime issues due to API changes in React.

== Reasoning

The extensibility api is designed to decouple the rendering of UI from BlueOcean.
To that end extensions implement a function that does the rendering.
Not only does it allow for greater flexibility as extensions can generate UI with any javascript library,
if plugins need to use React they can provide thier own version of it which lets BlueOcean not worry about upgrading itself.

ES5 compatibility was chosen to allow plugin developers to have the greatest flexibility with what Javascript technology they want to develop the extensions in.


== Backwards Compatibility

There are only a few BlueOcean plugins, however they will need to be updated to use this API.
An exact plan on migration needs to be worked out.

== Security

There are no security risks related to this proposal.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

* Unit tests to show that API is to spec
* BlueOcean Acceptance Test Harness will load extensions using this API for integration testing.

== Prototype Implementation
