== Abstract

On large-scale Jenkins instances master Disk and Network I/O become bottlenecks in particular cases.
Build logging and Task reporting are one for the most intensive I/O consumers,
hence it would be great to somehow redirect them to an external system.
This is a continuation of the original story we had back in 2016
(see the public design document
link:TODO[here]).
JEP-TODO defines requirements to the external logging system and Core APIs.

The External Logging API plugin is a separate plugin
which offers shared functionality to External Logging implementations.

* Configuration UI
* Extension Points for External Logging implementations
* Base classes for external logging,
which simplify implementations
* Other shared utility classes

== Specification

=== Event class

Event is an atomic entry of the external logging.
In the data model it includes the following fields:

* `id` (long) - ID of the message.
  It must be unique within a single `LoggingMethod` writer
* `message`(string) - Contains the message body.
  It may be a single-line or a multi-line message.
  The message may also contain annotations.
* `timestamp` (long) - Timestamp of the message,
  measured in milliseconds, between
  the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC
* `data` (`Map<String, Serializable>`) - additional metadata.
  This metadata will be used to categorize event entries.

Some metadata is mandatory.
Requited fields are defined below.

==== Event metadata

The following metadata entries are required to be present
for all event entries:

* `jenkinsId` - Instance ID of the Jenkins instance
* `loggableType`  - Type of the `Loggable` entry, e.g. `run`
* `loggableId` - Identifier of the `Loggable` entry

==== Run metadata

The following metadata entries are required to be present
for all `hudson.model.Run` event entries:

* All event metadata
* `jobId` - ID of the Job, should be provided by Unique ID Plugin

==== Pipeline metadata

* All Run metadata
* `stepId` - Identifier of the step ("node")

=== Extension Points

The plugin should offer the following extension points:

* `ExternalLoggingMethodFactory` -
produced `ExternalLoggingMethod` instances for Runs and, eventually, other objects.
This extension point implements `Describable`
and should be configurable via UI.
* `ExternalLogBrowserFactory` -
Same as above, but for `ExternalLogBrowser`

=== ExternalLoggingMethodFactory and classes

Produces `ExternalLoggingMethod` instances for Runs and, eventually, other objects.
This extension point implements `Describable`
and should be configurable via UI.

ExternalLoggingMethod is a new extension point on the top of `LoggingMethod`:

* It implements `LoggingMethod` interfaces
* It provides a new `createWriter()` method,
which produces a `ExternalLoggingEventWriter` class instance.
** This method automatically injects the mandatory metadata for events
** An abstract `_createWriter()` method is offered for implementation by downstream implementations
* Being compared to `LoggingMethod`,
the implementation is designed to always perform logging
from the agent side

ExternalLoggingEventWriter class:

* The class is `Serializable`.
It will be sent to the agent side.
* The class offers the following abstract methods:
** `void writeEvent(Event event) throws IOException`
- writing event to the remote storage
* The class also stores metadata, which may be injected into the events
** The class stores a Map of Serializable metadata entries
** The class offers API, which allow setting the metadata.
   This API will be used by `ExternalLoggingMethod` implementations and other logic
   to provide additional metadata if required

=== ExternalLogBrowserFactory and classes

This factory just produces instances of `ExternalLogBrowser`.
This class offers an abstraction layer for external log browsing.

`ExternalLogBrowser` will also provide an abstraction layer for
eventual consistency management.
This layer will be determined during reference implementation polishing.

=== Pipeline Bridge extensions

The plugin should also implement Pipeline `LogStorage` and `LogStorageFactory` extension points
so that it transparently supports Pipeline with existing API.

Pipeline Storage JEP is documented in JEP-TODO.

=== JSON-based external-logging layer

The API Plugin should offer a convenience layer in order
to support a number of most common logging providers like
Logstash, Fluentd, Elasticsearch, AWS CloudWatch, etc.

This layer should provide the following features:

* Utility classes for reading and writing JSON Events,
including parsing/writing `ConsoleNote` objects
* Base classes for constructing JSON queries for fetching data

Other convenience layers will be defined during prototyping.

=== Configuration

External Logging API plugin should be fully configurable via
WebUI and _Configuration-as-Code Plugin_.
It includes:

* Selection of `LoggingMethod` and `LogStorage` factories
* Configuration of built-in External Logging and Log Browser factories
* Any other configuration options

=== Reference implementation

As a reference implementation of the _External Logging API_ plugin,
a new _External Logging for Elasticsearch Plugin_ will be implemented.
Other implementations may be also created.

== Motivation

JEP-207 introduces a new API in the core for adding External logging features,
but it does not provide neither configuration UI nor convenient API for implementing these storage engines.
This API plugin does that.
One may say that all bits in the current design could be implemented
as a part of the Jenkins core.
It is true, but detaching of the plugin has the following motivation:

* The plugin will have a separate release cycle so that changes in it
  can be delivered and backported independently from the core's release cycle
* The approach allows keeping the patches on the core's side minimal
* The approach allows integrating with Pipeline Log Storage API introduced in Pipeline plugins (JEP-200)

All External Log Storage implementations are expected to extend this plugin
instead of just using API provided by the Core.
Core APIs may be still used to define custom `LoggingMethodLocator` impelemtations,
e.g. to define a custom logger allocation logic.

== Reasoning

=== Why do we introduce the Event layer?

Jenkins project usually operates with logs as data streams and lines,
especially on the agent side.
On the other hand, modern log storage systems operate with "events" -
atomic objects which may include multi-line strings and various metadata.
Example: exception stacktraces may go to log storage as a single event and
then they can be processed by external systems like Logstash if needed.
The idea in this plugin is to offer bridge logic which converts
stream-based logging into event-based logic.

Jesse Glick has raised the concern that Event layer may not be helpful
taking the current state,
because a lot of code would need to be updated so that the events get captured properly.
Opinion of the JEP sponsor is that this JEP offers a foundation layer
so that it may be implemented.
Reworking the entire Jenkins API to events is NOT an objective for this JEP-200,
but it may be added in subsequent JEPs.

=== Why do we need JSON layer?

Many popular log storage engines store events in a JSON format:
Fluentd, Logstash, Elasticsearch, AWS CloudWatch, etc.
Offering a JSON layer as a part of the API plugin could greatly
simplify such implementations.

=== Eventually-consistent storages

Some target storages are eventually consistent.
One cannot just write the data to remote storage and then reliably read it.
It is critical for log browsers:

* When a run finishes, querying data does not guarantee we get all the data
* `Loggable#isCompleted()` call is not enough,
some entries may be missing for "completed" entries

Such issue explains why we need a special watch layer to determine whether logs are actually completed.
It explains why we need a special logic/queries to determine whether the log is actually complete.

Full logic for the layer should be determined during reference implementation.

== Backwards Compatibility

The External Logging API plugin will follow the compatibility requirements
defined in the upstream JEP-TODO for the core.
It will also offer API for plugins, which will allow reporting incompatibilities.

== Security

There is no special security requirements defined at this level.
JEP-207 defines top-level security requirements.

== Infrastructure requirements

There is no special infrastructure requirements defined for
this JEP.
Subsequent JEPs for the implementations may define such infrastructure
requirements.

== Testing

=== Functional testing

All tests will be implemented using Jenkins Test Harness or
Acceptance Test Harness (ATH) frameworks.

The following use-cases must be covered:

* Backward compatibility
* Upgradeability - upgraded instances use the Filesystem Storage by default
* Smoke tests - logging Method locators are invoked for new runs

=== Integration testing

Once JENKINS-TODO is implemented, integration tests with _External Task Logging for Logstash Plugin_
and other reference implementations should be added to the
`essentialsTest()` run.

=== Load Testing

There is no special log testing requirements for this story.
External Logging API and its implementations are responsible to execute
performance and load testing,
if deemed necessary.
