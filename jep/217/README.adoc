== Abstract

This JEP documents the `jenkins4eval` organization on DockerHub.
The main purpose of this organization is to provide a storage for experimental Jenkins Docker images
so that maintainers can build and deploy untrusted images from ci.jenkins.io.

== Specification

The most of the specification is defined in the _Infrastructure Requirements_ section.
This section contains only specific details about the process.

=== Requesting hosting

1. Hosting requests should be submitted via JIRA issues
   (`project=INFRA`, component=`dockerhub`)
2. The following details should be in the issues description:
** Name of the image to be created
** Reference to the GitHub repository which defines the Docker image.
   The repository should be located within one of the Jenkins GitHub organizations
** Users which should have write access to the repository
** Build flow to be configured: ci.jenkins.io, manual, automatic builds
** For link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/[automatic builds on DockerHub],
   full specification should be provided (branches/tags to build, triggers, locations of Dockerfiles)
3. Once the request is submitted,
   it will be reviewed by the Jenkins infrastructure team


=== Implementation on ci.jenkins.io

1. Implementation on ci.jenkins.io may be using CLI steps or Docker Pipeline plugin
   to build and deploy images on agents labeled with the `docker` label
2. In the case of CLI steps, `infra.withDockerCredentials {}` wrapper
   should be used to setup credentials in the environment
3. Jenkinsfile maintainers are responsible to ensure that the credentials
   are properly escaped in the build logs and not exposed in other ways

Example:

[source, groovy]
----
stage('Publish') {
    infra.withDockerCredentials {
        sh 'make publish'
    }
}
----

== Motivation

In Jenkins Platform SIG there are projects which target Jenkins Docker packaging:
Java 11 support and multi-architecture Docker images.
Both these projects need to update the release flow of the official link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker[jenkins/jenkins]
Docker image.
Currently this flow is hosted on the Jenkins' Trusted CI instance which is not accessible to the SIG members.
During the Java 11 support project we had 2 major issues with releases,
because we were unable to debug the release flow or to troubleshoot the failures.
In order to simplify development in the future,
this JEP proposes to create a new DockerHub organization which would be accessible
from the public ci.jenkins.io instance.
It would give Docker image maintainers a way to prototype and debug their `Jenkinsfile`s before running them on Trusted CI.

Such organization also gives some extra advantages:

* Image maintainers can setup a CD process for their experimental images by using Jenkins.
  It allows working around many DockerHub automatic build limitations
* It is also possible to create repositories with manual deployments and
  automatic builds on DockerHub

== Reasoning

=== DockerHub vs. custom Docker registry

Usage of a custom Docker registry was proposed as an alternative to the experimental
organization on DockerHub.
This approach has the following disadvantages:

* Users need to reconfigure their images to use another Docker registry
* It is not possible to get
  link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/[automatic builds on DockerHub],
  which is essential to some experimental images before the Jenkins flow is deployed
* Custom infrastructure is required

After the discussion it was decided to go forward with the DockerHub organization approach.

=== DockerHub organization naming

When the DockerHub org name was discussed at the Platform SIG meeting,
the agreement was to have `jenkins-experimental` as a name of the organization.
Unfortunately DockerHub does not support naming with dashes
(link:https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/373[Issue #373]).
An alternative name was selected to match the requirement.

== Backwards Compatibility

There is no backward compatibility requirements in this JEP.

== Security

* `jenkins4eval` is explicitly considered as *untrusted* DockerHub organization,
  because it will be possible to perform deployments to it from ci.jenkins.io
* Users of the `jenkins4eval` images run the images at their own risk
* The security considerations will be explicitly documented in the
  organization description and images
* DockerHub generic account will have no access to production DockerHub images

== Infrastructure Requirements

=== New Dockerhub organization

A new DockerHub organization should be created.

* Name: `jenkins4eval`.
* Administrators: same as in https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins

=== DockerHub generic account for jenkins4eval

In order to enable deployments from ci.jenkins.io,
a new DockerHub generic account should be created.

* The account has no *WRITE* access to any repository within `jenkins` and `jenkinsci`
* The account may get write access to some repositories on `jenkins4eval`
  so that the automated builds can be established on ci.jenkins.io

=== ci.jenkins.io

* New credentials should be created for the generic account
* Credentials ID should be the same as DockerHub credentials ID being used
  by Trusted CI to deploy official Docker images

== Testing

Testing will be performed by several reference implementations on ci.jenkins.io.
