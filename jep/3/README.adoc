== Abstract

This JEP targets improving experience for Jenkins users who review statuses of issues in JIRA
to understand the fix/release status.

== Specification

=== UPDATE: Modify the workflow in the JENKINS project

. Add new “Fixed But Not Released” state (aka "Stage Release")
** Instead of "In Progress" => "Resolved", contributors can optionally move integrated fixed into the "Fixed But Not Released" state
. All current transitions in JENKINS workflow should be retained.
JIRA tickets can be moved to “Resolved” state from any existing state
** “In Review” => “Resolved” is a default transition in UI so that the change is not disruptive

The proposed workflow change may be adopted in other projects (e.g. _SECURITY_),
but it is outside of this JEP scope.

=== ADD: an optional "Released As" field to JIRA (type=String)

* When a contributor moves the issue to "Fixed But Not Released", "Resolved" or "Closed" state, an optional “Released as” field appears in the dialog
* Type of the field: String (see the _Reasoning_ section below)
* Version format in the field is up to maintainers
* Description should have a recommendation to use comma-separated list of git tags
(e.g. “jenkins-2.74,remoting-3.11” or “git-3.2.3”)
* If the field is non-empty, it will appear in the ticket header,
hence users won't need to look into comments and commit histories

=== UPDATE: Modify JIRA issue linking bot

Current code location:
https://github.com/cloudbees/java.net-scm-issue-link

Changes to be done:

* “FIXED JENKINS-123” should now move the tickets to the “Fixed But Not Released” state in JIRA in the following components:
** Jenkins core
** All modules and libraries bundled into the Jenkins core
** Remoting Library
** Winstone
** Extras Executable WAR
* JIRA issue link bot documentation should describe a way to change flow in other components if needed
* TBD: Automatically fill in the “Released as” field according to POM.xml (proposed by Ullrich Hafner)

== Motivation

As a Jenkins contributor, I see many users struggling to understand the issue statuses and the version including the fix.
Currently we have an issue with the _FIXED_ status.
Depending on the component type, it may mean "merged" or "released".
E.g. Jenkins JIRA linking bot automatically marks merged tickets with "FIXED" keyword as _FIXED_.
Users usually understand "FIXED" as "released, please update".
Such ambiguity causes users to spend time checking update centers and commits in GitHub.
It does not improve the overall user experience.

I would like to make issue statuses more explicit at least in the kernel components
(Core, Remoting, detached plugins).
It could be also helpful for plugins which do not release the integrated fixes immediately.
For plugins this change would be an opt-in in order to avoid impact on established workflows used by plugin maintainers.

== Reasoning

* The current specification has been created according to the feedback from Jenkins contributors
in the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EIRuCMOjmPgpxybkWRPHfx1f1yglcuYlqPWN8K1Ni28/edit#[original proposal].
* The proposed changes are opt-in in order to address feedback from
link:https://github.com/uhafner[Ulli Hafner] and link:https://github.com/i386[James Dumay].


The following feedback has been addressed:

. Ullrich Hafner: Impact on plugin maintainers
** The document has been updated to make all changes opt-in
. James Dumay: Impact on custom dashboards/reports
** There may be some updates required in custom dashboards if they filter the statuses by value
** Mitigation: The change will be announced in the blogpost with detailed description of the change and potential impact
. James Dumay: Current JIRA structure does not address my needs. Instead of that, let's move plugins to separate projects
** JEP Sponsor feels that splitting plugins to separate projects may be feasible,
but it requires a huge amount of time to implement it gracefully without a serious impact on Jira users
** The changes proposed in this JEP are compatible with the approach proposed by James Dumay
** JEP Sponsor decided not to go that far with this JEP, it may be a subject for follow-up changes
. James Dumay: Let's use JIRA versions instead of String fields
** JIRA does not support per-component versions.
With the single-project structure we would end up with huge list within the _JENKINS_ JIRA project
** JEP Sponsor decided to keep his proposal as is (with "String type")

== Backwards Compatibility

N/A

== Security

N/A

== Infrastructure Requirements

* Workflows need to be updated for the `JENKINS` project in JIRA

== Testing

* New JIRA workflows will be tested using the _TEST_ project
* Issue linking bot will be tested using the test project in JIRA

== Prototype Implementation

This change does not impact Jenkins codebase itself.
A prototype can be set up on Jenkins JIRA site once the JEP is accepted as a draft.
