== Abstract

Jenkins web UI relies on Stapler framework, which uses a JSON payload to bind web form inputs
to Java model. Processing this payload to match Java model constraint use to be implemented with
human written code. This is both annoying to write and prevent automatic discovery of this model
by third party tools, like Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration-as-Code (JEP-201).

This document describe how we can rely on annotation on code to implement those exact same
constraints in a declarative way, making developer life easier, and enabling better tooling.

== Specification

Declarative Data Binding do define annotations to enable data-binding. This is an opt-in mechanism, an
arbitrary class can't be used for DataBinding.

`@DataBound` can be applied to class, method or filed. Annotated element has to be public, but
using this annotation will mark it `@Restricted(NoExternalUse)` to avoid direct (mis)use by third party components,
as a DataBound component do expect a specific lifecycle (instanciation, data injection, validation, post-construction).

`@Trim` annotation is defined to handle a common development pattern to trim strings and convert empty strings
to null (or the opposite) as in most cases they actually reflect unset values. This annotation enable
transformation on the payload before value is injected. We define two trim strategies: `TO_NULL` (default one)
and `TO_EMPTY`.

== Motivation

http://stapler.kohsuke.org/[Stapler] framework is the backbone of Jenkins web UI. It is designed to
offer data-binding from a (jelly or groovy) web view to Java model. For this purpose, a JSON payload
is sent when a configuration form is submitted, and Stapler do convert this back to java model classes
using a "DataBound" constructor and optional setters.

This mechanism offers some discoverable data model on the Java API : the DataBound constructor and setters
let us know about the name and types of the expected payload. This is the basis for Configuration-as-Code
(JEP-201). But this model is pretty poor: the only constraint we know on attribute is the expected type.
In many cases, some additional requirement are checked with human-written code. Typically, parameters get
trimmed, checked for being empty or null, ensure value belongs to some range or match a pattern, etc.

On the other way, the web UI form is build by accessing live Java model data using read methods, being
converted to plain strings. It's up to the plugin developer to define constraints on the html elements
so they reflect the data model.

Generally speaking, with every single line of human-written code to handle data binding we introduce
development effort / risk to introduce bugs, an we block opportunity for third-party component to discover
the underlying data model.


== Reasoning

Annotations have been used intensively by many frameworks to define metadata on data model expressed as
Java classes. Typically, https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338[Java Persistence API] allows to define
how a Java object can be mapped to a database, while https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=222[JAXB] define
annotations to customize how java attribute will be mapped to xml elements.

This JEP is about introducing support for annotation-based declarative data binding. A DataBound jenkins
component would only rely on annotation to define how attributes are bound to JSON payload from web forms,
including validation constraints. We consider this would have two major benefits :

1. Plugin developers will need to write less code, and use standard annotations they probably already know
from other Java related developments.

2. Constraints on the data model can be introspected. This will allow third party tools to adjust their
behavior accordingly. A good candidates for this is Configuration-as-Code (JEP-201). Jelly tags use to
compose the web UI also could introspect those annotations. Typically, if some attribute is a number and
has to be positive, `<input type='number' 'min=0'>` html 5 element would be automatically generated.

==== Relying on Bean Validation

https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=222[Bean Validation] is an annotation-based framework designed for
generic usage defining constraints validation on data in a Java model. It allows definition of model
constraints in a fully declarative way, and define the mechanism to run validation and discover violations.

Bean Validation also is extensible by developers who can define custom annotations and rules to implement
them.

==== Relying on JSON-B

http://json-b.net/[Json-B] (JSR 367) is the approved specification for JSON binding. It has been highly
inspired by https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] and do define the exact binding requirements
Stapler do implement, but relying on standard annotations (vs custom `@DataBoundConstructor`.

As Stapler will still need to support legacy data-binding for backward compatibility, we can't just replace
it with a Json-B implementation. We could consider adding support for such standard annotations as
alternatives to stapler specific ones. But on the other way a Jenkins databound component is nothing like
a reusable piece of software, and the https://javadoc.io/doc/javax.json.bind/javax.json.bind-api/1.0[Json-B annotations]
are mostly designed to tune Java to Json conversion, not providing huge benefits.

==== Filed vs Setter injection

An endless debate for annotation based framework is about using annotations on private fields, vs using them
on accessors. Most frameworks do support both as there's no single answer to this debate.

On one side, injection on private field require Java reflexion to unlock private field accessibility (or
use Variable Handles on java 9+). It makes testing harder as there's no trivial way to mock or instantiate
the target component.

On the other side, setter injection require some boilerplate code being added to codebase, and don't prevent
external component to create an instance without invoking such setters, resulting in misconfigured component.
Same applies to any `@PostConstruct` initializer method.

Generally speaking, a component designed for data-binding can't guarantee it exposes a safe API until there's just
a single constructor to require and validate all attributes. From this point of view, we consider a web UI
databound component in Jenkins is nothing but a reusable component, and as such should never be used outside this
very specific context.

Based on this:

1. databinding annotations can be used both on fields and accessors
1. elements annotated databinding annotation will be automatically marked a restricted so they are not exposed as
"public API" whatever their Java visibility is.

== Backwards Compatibility

Annotation based databinding comes in addition to the legacy mechanisms supporter by stapler, so don't break
backward compatibility.
