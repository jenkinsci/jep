= Jenkins Enhancement Proposals

JEP stands for Jenkins Enhancement Proposal.
A JEP is a design document that describes a new feature or aspect of the core Jenkins code, a plugin, or the Jenkins project, its processes, or its environment.
A JEP provides a concise technical specification of the feature,
describes the motivation for the change,
and discusses the rationale behind the design.

JEPs are the primary mechanism for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Jenkins.

* See link:jep/1/README.adoc[JEP-1] for a description of JEPs and the JEP process.
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/README.adoc[Index of all JEPs] approved at least as drafts.

There is also a video of a presentation giving an

Each week we have Jenkins Enhancement Proposal Office Hours. The time and link to these can be found on https://jenkins.io/event-calendar/.
